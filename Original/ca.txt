7782: What now?

7783: I wonder what Jack would do.
---
7784: I´m not sure.{:delay 6B 00}{:clear }I suppose...he´d run for it.
---
7785: Sounds good to me.
---
7786: Will!
---
7787: Everyone hit the deck!
---
7788: We´re just gonna have to fight!
---
7789: Now, let´s be tryin´ this again! The last
of the Aztec treasure has been returned.
---
7790: And now, the blood will be repaid to
free us from this curse forever!
---
7791: This time for sure!
---
7792: Ahoy! Treasure, mateys!

7793: Not possible.

7800: No more playacting now!

7801: Thank you, Sora.

7802: Uh, where´s Jack?

7803: Jack! Get him!

7804: Huh?
---
7805: Jack!

7806: You´re a fool, Jack Sparrow.

7807: Jack...

7808: Show yourself, Pete!
The tide has changed.

7809: See? I told ya you´d
be needin´ ol´ Pete!

7879: Elizabeth is the governor's daughter.
It's hard to imagine, isn't it?{:clear }She's from a completely different world
compared to a blacksmith like me.
But that doesn't seem to matter.
---
7880: I wish I could go with you...
Please bring Will back.{:clear }They´re probably holding him in
the {:theme 0A}back of that cave{:reset}, where they held me.
---
7881: We have to hurry and rescue Miss Swann!
Are you ready to leave port?
---
7882: {:unk13 00 01 40 01}{:unk08 02 00 06}Board the ship and leave?
{:chardelay 33 00}I´m not ready yet.
{:chardelay 09 00}I´m ready!
---
7883: I fought with Jack once.
Afterwards he was sent to jail.{:clear }He didn´t stay in there long, though.
He´s a pirate to the core.
---
7884: If you want to change our course,
why don´t you try asking?{:clear }It sure is a lot of work to move a ship,
though. I´m pooped!
---
7885: If you get tired, you can rest in
the cargo hold below.{:clear }Even if enemies attack,
you should be safe there.
---
7886: When I was little, the ship I was on
discovered Will drifting in the ocean.{:clear }After we picked him up, I found he
was carrying... Um...never mind.
---
7887: They´ve rigged the ship
with {:theme 0A}explosives{:reset}!{:clear }You have to throw them overboard
once you get up to the deck!{:clear }Who knows what else they´ve done?
Please be careful!
---
7888: This ship may look old,
but she sure is fast.{:clear }If you need to rest, you can use
the captain´s room below.
---
7889: Jack seems to think of this ship
almost as a friend.{:clear }We´d better prepare ourselves,
so no harm comes to it.
---
7890: Where did those monsters come from?
There may be {:theme 0A}more of them nearby{:reset}.{:clear }Sorry, everyone, but I need some rest.
Do be careful.
---
7891: I can´t believe they are trying to
harness the power of the Aztec gold.{:clear }Those monsters will be invincible until we
return all the medallions. We´d better hurry.
---
7892: We have to get to Port Royal!{:clear }We can´t let them run loose
in town!

7893: How could Will have gone to {:theme 0A}Isla de Muerta{:reset}
all by himself!? Oh, I hope he´s all right...

7894: Jack´s acting as strange as ever,
but at least Will´s safe.{:clear }Still, for some reason
I feel uneasy...
---
7895: {:theme 0A}Isla de Muerta, the ship graveyard...{:reset}
Those monsters seem to like creepy places.{:clear }Maybe they feel at home in places like that.
Personally those places make my skin crawl!

9957: Whoa! Now I get what you were sayin´...

it´d do to ya.{:delay C6 00}{:clear }´Specially when the moon´s

9959: A match for Barbossa, you say?

9960: Hey!

9961: See there? I knew it!{:delay AE 00}{:clear }Those are the punks I

9964: Whoa! I like your style.

9965: Men--half of you stay here
and indulge these cullies.{:delay AE 00}{:clear }The rest--bring me that medallion!

9966: Aye!

9967: Aw, we only get to stomp on a few of you?

9968: It´s no use! We can´t beat them!

9971: You best be sayin´ your prayers!

9972: Hey, watch out! They can see ya!{:delay 80 00}{:clear }Stay away from their magic!

9973: What for?

9974: Weren´t you listenin´ to me before?

9976: {:unk13 1C 01 4E 00}{:unk08 01 01 06}Hey! This ain´t over!

9977: {:unk13 45 01 C6 00}{:unk08 01 00 01}If Pete´s here, that must
mean we have work to do.
---
9978: {:unk13 54 01 0E 01}{:unk08 01 00 02}Yep.{:clear }And that pirate captain
looked pretty mean, too.

9979: {:unk13 45 01 C6 00}{:unk08 01 00 01}Man, I´d hate to see him
turn into a Heartless.

9981: {:unk13 AB 00 39 00}{:unk08 01 01 07}Hey, maybe we can take a

9982: {:unk13 C5 00 37 00}{:unk08 01 01 07}Just kidding!{:clear }Weren´t those guys

9983: {:unk13 24 01 E6 00}{:unk08 01 00 01}Yeah. I think they were

9987: What are they?

9991: {:unk13 B1 00 39 00}{:unk08 01 01 07}Well done!{:clear }My own fencing skills are

foes such as that before.

9992: {:unk13 C8 00 EC 00}{:unk08 01 00 01}You really think we´re that good?

9993: {:unk13 16 01 F6 00}{:unk08 01 00 01}Did you find your friend?

9994: {:unk13 D5 00 39 00}{:unk08 01 01 07}I was too late. But

9996: {:unk13 C2 00 39 00}{:unk08 01 01 07}And I´m William Turner,

9997: {:unk13 BF 00 F5 00}{:unk08 01 00 01}Okay, Will.
Let´s go!
---
9998: {:unk13 D9 00 39 00}{:unk08 01 01 07}Right. We´ve got to
get to the docks!
---
9999: We´re too late!
---
10000: Huh?
---
10001: Those pirates kidnapped Miss Swann
and took her to their ship.{:delay B4 00}{:clear } {:delay 35 00}{:clear }Now they´ve sailed, and I´ll
never be able to find her!
---
10002: Then she´s long gone.
The Black Pearl is nigh uncatchable.
---
10003: Best find yourself
another girl, mate.
---
10004: You... What are you doing
aboard the Interceptor?{:delay AE 00}{:clear } {:delay 39 00}{:clear }She´s off limits to civilians.
---
10005: Ah, fortunate that I´m going
to commandeer her, then.{:delay BE 00}{:clear }She´ll make a fine
pirate ship.
---
10006: A pirate!
---
10007: Captain Jack Sparrow, if you please.
---
10008: Take me with you. Help me hunt down
the Black Pearl and save Miss Swann.{:delay EA 00}{:clear } {:delay 3A 00}{:clear }I got you out of that jail cell, Sparrow.
Do this and your debt´s repaid.
---
10009: You´ll have to win fair
lady´s heart alone, mate.{:delay 9D 00}{:clear }I see no profit in it for me.
---
10010: C´mon, Captain!
---
10011: Are you sure you can sail
her, all on your own?
---
10012: You´ve a point there.
---
10013: Thanks, Sparrow.
---
10014: CAPTAIN Sparrow.
---
10015: I´m Sora. This is Donald and Goofy.
---
10016: I´m Will Turner.
---
10017: That would be short for
William, I imagine.{:delay 89 00}{:clear }No doubt named for your father, eh?
---
10018: Yes.
---
10019: Well, then, Mr. Turner.{:delay 60 00}{:clear }You get us ready to make way.
I´ve some effects to liberate.
---
10020: Aye aye! But hurry.
---
10021: Naturally.
---
10022: Sora...
---
10023: You really wanna be a pirate?
---
10024: Of course not!
---
10025: What do you make of this Will?
---
10026: I don´t know. We just met him.
---
10027: Hmm... I think my luck´s
about to change.
---
10028: {:unk13 01 01 D1 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}Shall we be on our way?
---
10029: You can release me.{:delay 5A 00}{:clear } {:delay 39 00}{:clear }You have your trinket; I´m
of no further value to you.
---
10030: This is no trinket, missy.
This is cursed Aztec gold.{:delay 5C 01}{:clear }One of eight hundred and eighty-two identical
pieces they delivered in a stone chest{:delay FC 00}{:clear }to Cortez himself.
---
10031: I hardly believe in ghost stories
anymore, Captain Barbossa.
---
10032: That´s exactly what I thought.{:delay 77 00}{:clear }Buried on an Island of Dead
what cannot be found{:delay A5 00}{:clear }´cept for those who know
where it is.{:delay A5 00}{:clear }Find it, we did.{:delay 66 00}{:clear }There be the chest. Inside be the gold.
And we took ´em all!{:delay 14 01}{:clear }We spent ´em and traded ´em and frittered
´em away on drink and food and{:delay 14 01}{:clear }pleasurable company.{:delay 72 00}{:clear }The more we gave ´em away,
the more we came to realize...{:delay 0B 01}{:clear }the drink would not satisfy,{:delay 8A 00}{:clear }and food turned to ash in our mouths.{:delay EA 00}{:clear }We are cursed men, Miss Turner.
Compelled by greed, we were,{:delay FC 00}{:clear }but now...
we are consumed by it.
---
10033: How very sad for you.
---
10034: {:delay 78 00}{:clear }There is one way we can end our curse.{:delay C1 00}{:clear }All the scattered pieces of the Aztec gold must
be gathered and restored to the stone chest.{:delay 64 01}{:clear }And the blood of every soul who touched
a piece o´ the treasure must be repaid.
---
10035: Miss Turner! For ten years we´ve searched
every league of these waters,{:delay 50 01}{:clear }every town and village--preying
on sailors and settlers alike!{:delay 4A 01}{:clear }Eight hundred and eighty-one pieces we found,
but despaired of ever finding the last.{:delay 86 01}{:clear }All those years, you been safe in your bed,{:delay D8 00}{:clear }readin´ your pirate stories,
dreamin´ of adventures on the high seas--{:delay 32 01}{:clear }we´ve endured torments
worse than death itself!
---
10036: But now, thanks to ye,{:delay B4 00}{:clear }we have the final piece--
at last.{:delay 14 01}{:clear }When this medallion is restored to the chest,
we´ll be free to roam the seas as men.{:delay 92 01}{:clear }No longer will we be ghosts!
---
10037: And the blood that´s to be repaid?
---
10038: That´s why there´s no sense
to be killin´ ye...yet.
---
10039: Ye see, the moonlight shows
us for what we really are.{:delay 68 01}{:clear }We are not among the livin´,
and so we cannot die.{:delay 3E 01}{:clear }But neither are we dead.{:delay CC 00}{:clear }I´ve suffered too long!
---
10040: You´d best start believin´ in
ghost stories, Miss Turner.{:delay 3B 01}{:clear }For, you see, tonight--you´re in one!
---
10041: {:unk13 F2 00 9F 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}Why are you so fixated
on that compass?
---
10042: {:unk13 6F 01 17 01}{:unk08 01 00 01}It´ll be she that leads
us to the Isla de
Muerta--{:clear }where Barbossa´s
headed. Savvy?
---
10043: {:unk13 1E 01 90 00}{:unk08 01 01 06}How do you know?
---
10044: {:unk13 A4 00 DA 00}{:unk08 01 01 01}Ah, lad...{:clear }He and I once had our eyes
on a treasure--Aztec gold.{:clear }´Twas hidden on the
Isla de Muerta.{:clear }But he turned traitor
and stole my ship.
---
10045: {:unk13 7A 01 99 00}{:unk08 01 00 01}So he´s after that
treasure, then.
---
10046: {:unk13 B4 00 FC 00}{:unk08 01 00 02}Treasure´s
already his.{:clear }So´s the curse upon it.{:clear }I´ve no desire for such
treacherous spoils.{:clear }But I will have back
what´s mine--{:clear }the Black Pearl.
---
10047: {:unk13 3D 01 FA 00}{:unk08 01 01 01}You lads
wait here.{:clear }Young Turner and I
will rescue the lady.
---
10048: {:unk13 B7 00 34 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}Hey! What about us?
---
10049: {:unk13 3D 01 FA 00}{:unk08 01 01 01}You´re to guard the
ship, o´ course.{:clear }It´s a task given only
to the bravest pirates.
---
10050: {:unk13 A3 00 36 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}All right...
---
10051: {:unk13 20 01 E2 00}{:unk08 01 01 02}Guard her well!
---
10052: {:unk13 F7 00 A7 00}{:unk08 01 00 01}Shall we?
---
10053: {:unk13 0E 01 39 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}I think he was just
trying to fast-talk us...
---
10054: {:unk13 1B 01 A6 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}And you fell for it.
---
10055: {:unk13 E1 00 2C 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}What´s keeping those two?
---
10056: {:unk13 0C 01 3F 00}{:unk08 01 01 06}They sure are taking their time...
---
10057: {:unk13 4D 01 39 00}{:unk08 01 00 04}If Pete´s hanging around, there
must be Heartless here, too.{:clear }And Jack and Will aren´t used
to fighting Heartless...
---
10058: {:unk13 D6 00 2C 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}Let´s go see.
---
10059: Every last piece that went astray
we have returned, save for this!
---
10060: And now, the blood will be repaid to
free us from this curse forever!
---
10061: Quick, they´re after us!
---
10062: We´ll hold them off! Give us a sign
when the ship´s ready to sail!
---
10063: Right! We´ll light the signal fire!

10064: The signal!
---
10065: {:unk13 DD 00 74 00}{:unk08 01 01 06}Where´s Jack?

10066: {:unk13 C4 00 85 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}Well...

free us from this curse forever!

10068: No! Not yet.{:delay 47 00}{:clear } {:delay 44 00}{:clear }We wait for the opportune moment.
---
10069: When it´s of greatest profit to you?
---
10070: May I ask you something?
---
10071: Have I ever given you
reason not to trust me?{:delay 91 00}{:clear }Stay here...
and try not to do anything stupid.
---
10072: Begun by blood...by blood undone.
---
10073: You! Maid! Your father.
Was your father William Turner!?
---
10074: No.
---
10075: What´s going on?
---
10076: Who brought this wench to us?

10077: She said her name was Turner!

10078: Hurry!

10079: You there!

10080: The medallion!

10081: After them, you ingrates!

10082: {:unk13 0A 01 39 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}I had to.{:clear }Jack´s no fairy-tale
pirate. {:clear }The real ones aren´t
to be trusted.

10083: {:unk13 11 01 39 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}We sail for Port Royal.
I´ll take the helm.
---
10084: Is it true? You gave Barbossa
my name instead of yours.
---
10085: Why choose my name?
---
10086: I don´t know.
---
10087: Elizabeth...where did you get that?

he sent it to me.
---
10090: I´m sorry.
---
10091: Why did you take it?
---
10092: Because I was afraid
that you were a pirate.{:delay 12 01}{:clear }That would have been awful.
---
10093: Of course...{:delay 94 00}{:clear }Don´t you see?{:delay 2A 00}{:clear } {:delay 85 00}{:clear }It wasn´t your blood they needed...
it was my father´s blood--

10094: My blood.{:delay BE 00}{:clear }The blood...{:delay 3C 00}{:clear } {:delay BA 00}{:clear }of a pirate.

10095: How the blazes did you get
off that island, Jack?

10096: When you sailed away in my ship and marooned

10097: I won´t be makin´ that mistake again.
---
10098: Then what say you to puttin´ the past behind us,{:delay B1 00}{:clear }untying these ropes, and letting me negotiate
the return of your medallion, eh?{:delay 0B 01}{:clear }What say you to that?
---
10099: Seein´ as how the Black Pearl´s mine now, Jack,{:delay DE 00}{:clear }lettin´ you go doesn´t seem
to fall within my interest.
---
10100: Odd, {:delay 36 00}{:clear }I´m not actually concerned
with YOUR INTEREST.{:delay C8 00}{:clear }Give me back the Pearl!
---
10102: All right! Lock him in the brig!
---
10103: We´re comin´ up on
the Interceptor.{:delay 6F 00}{:clear }What do we do, Captain?
---
10104: Whaddya think, you idiot?
---
10105: Hooray!
---
10106: We beat the pirates!
---
10107: Well, did you now, laddie?
---
10108: Jack!
---
10109: 
---
10110: Now then, I´ll be having
back that medallion.
---
10111: Unless it´s more important than their lives?
---
10112: Barbossa!
---
10113: She goes free!
---
10114: Go ahead, boy--shoot! We can't die.
---
10115: You can´t...{:delay 3C 00}{:clear } {:delay A8 00}{:clear }But I can.
---
10116: My name is Will Turner!{:delay 78 00}{:clear }My father was Bootstrap Bill Turner!
His blood runs in my veins!
---
10117: On my word, do as I say,{:delay 74 00}{:clear }or I'll pull this trigger and be
lost to Davy Jones's locker.
---
10118: Name your terms...Mr. Turner.
---
10119: Release Elizabeth...and Sora, and Donald,{:delay A4 00}{:clear }and Goofy, too!
---
10120: Anythin´ else?
---
10121: Leave--now!
---
10122: Agreed. Leave we shall...
---
10123: but the Heartless stay!
---
10125: No fair!
---
10126: {:unk13 95 01 74 00}{:unk08 01 00 02}Good work,
Barbossa!{:clear }Who knew it´d
be this easy?
---
10127: {:unk13 58 00 9B 00}{:unk08 01 01 05}Barbossa,
you coward!
---
10128: {:unk13 1F 01 B9 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}That´s the last time
I trust a pirate!
---
10129: {:unk13 C3 00 57 00}{:unk06 02}The powder kegs are
ready, Captain!
---
10130: {:unk13 12 01 77 00}{:unk08 01 01 02}Then I bid ye farewell!
---
10131: {:unk13 32 01 49 00}{:unk08 03 01 05}{:unk06 02}What are we gonna do!?
---
10132: {:unk13 97 01 01 01}{:unk08 03 00 01}{:unk06 02}We´ll be blown
to smithereens!
---
10133: {:unk13 55 01 0B 01}{:unk08 01 00 01}Why struggle, mate?{:clear }A pirate knows
when to surrender.
---
10134: {:unk13 92 00 77 00}{:unk08 01 01 05}Are you serious, Jack?
---
10135: {:unk13 10 01 03 01}{:unk08 01 00 02}Your average pirate, anyway.
---
10136: {:unk13 64 01 A3 00}{:unk08 01 00 02}First, we´ve got to
see to the gunpowder.{:clear }I´m not about to
lose this ship!
---
10137: {:unk13 FE 00 DD 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}I still don´t plan to
trust pirates again.
---
10138: {:unk13 93 01 7E 00}{:unk08 01 00 01}Wise policy, lad.
---
10139: All clear!
---
10140: That´s the second time I´ve had to
watch that man sail away with my ship.{:delay D8 00}{:clear }But I´ll be havin´ her back soon enough.
---
10141: {:unk13 4C 01 50 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}You stay with
the ship, lass!
---
10142: {:unk13 FA 00 39 00}{:unk08 01 00 04}I´ll do no such thing!
Will could die in there.
---
10143: {:unk13 4C 01 50 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}Dear William is
fine. Trust me.
---
10144: {:unk13 FC 00 2F 00}{:unk08 01 00 04}I am not a fool, Jack.
---
10145: {:unk13 A0 01 76 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}Then trust
me instead!
---
10146: {:unk13 27 01 39 00}{:unk08 01 00 04}Sora, Donald, Goofy--
bring Will back safely!
---
10147: This ain´t over!
---
10148: Right! Care to surrender, Barbossa?
---
10149: Well, enough of this, then...
---
10150: What say you we call it--a draw?
---
10151: Jack, how many times do I have to tell ya--
---
10153: Laugh while you can, Barbossa!
---
10154: I feel...cold.
---
10155: What now, Jack?
---
10156: Whatever I want, now that
the Pearl is mine again.
---
10157: That she is.{:delay 3C 00}{:clear }{:delay 3C 00}{:clear }Thank you, Jack.
---
10158: I didn´t want ye hittin´ me again, mate.
---
10159: Hey, Jack--good luck.
---
10160: And remember to be good!
---
10161: I´m off.
---
10162: Will!
---
10163: Good for them.
---
10164: Uh-huh!
---
10165: Hey, Sora--{:delay 40 00}{:clear }how come your face is all red?
---
10166: What? It is not red!
---
10167: Aw, I know who you´re thinking about.
---
10168: 
---
10169: You know...for a minute there...{:delay 99 00}{:clear }I was afraid we were gonna lose Donald
to the curse of the treasure!
---
10170: Yup. Me, too.
---
10171: What!?
---
10172: {:unk13 51 01 4D 01}{:unk08 01 00 01}That´s coming from the port.
---
10173: {:unk13 05 01 82 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}Let´s check it out.
---
10174: Jack!
---
10175: Zola! Some assistance!
---
10176: That´s SORA, Donald, and Goofy!
---
10177: Will ye leave a mate to perish?
---
10178: Aye aye...
---
10180: {:unk13 F3 00 39 00}{:unk08 01 00 04}Some scallywag
must´ve got greedy.
---
10181: {:unk13 C8 00 39 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}Oh, I see...{:clear }You don´t trust
me, do you?
---
10182: {:unk13 CF 00 39 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}Likely a wise choice.
I AM a pirate, mates.
---
10183: {:unk13 69 00 96 00}{:unk08 03 00 04}{:unk06 02}Jack! Sora!
---
10184: {:unk13 16 01 9E 00}{:unk08 01 01 06}Elizabeth!
---
10185: {:unk13 87 00 1D 01}{:unk08 02 01 01}Some sticky business
is afoot, I fear.
---
10187: {:unk13 FA 00 46 00}{:unk08 01 01 07}Aye, there it is.{:clear }If you´ll be wanting
him rescued,
best do it alone, lass.
---
10188: {:unk13 01 01 39 00}{:unk08 01 00 04}Alone? Really, Jack?{:clear }Sail to the island and take
on the cursed pirates?
---
10189: {:unk13 03 01 2F 00}{:unk08 01 01 07}Well, if any lass could...
---
10190: {:unk13 E4 00 6A 00}{:unk08 01 01 05}Are you sure he´s in trouble?
---
10191: {:unk13 01 01 39 00}{:unk08 01 00 04}No. Not certain. But he´s
been gone too long.{:clear }I wanted to go with him,{:clear }but he insisted
I stay here.{:clear }I can´t just sit and wait!{:clear }I´ve got to know
if he´s all right.
---
10192: {:unk13 1F 01 2F 00}{:unk08 01 01 07}Lucky man...
---
10193: {:unk13 D4 00 39 00}{:unk08 01 00 04}Please, Jack.
Take me to him!
---
10194: {:unk13 FA 00 39 00}{:unk08 01 01 07}Hold a moment.{:clear }I see no profit
in it for me.
---
10195: {:unk13 E8 00 39 00}{:unk08 01 00 04}I shall reward you.
Of course...{:clear }you do owe Will.{:clear }He has saved your
life before.
---
10196: {:unk13 B0 00 42 00}{:unk08 01 01 07}Right. Shall we?
---
10197: Interceptor off the starboard bow!
---
10198: Will!
---
10199: Stop that, Jack.
---
10200: We´ve got to rescue him!
---
10201: Will, wake up.
---
10202: {:delay 0A 01}{:clear }Elizabeth...
---
10203: What happened?
---
10204: The medallions...{:delay 55 00}{:clear }and...the stone chest--
someone´s taken them...{:delay DF 00}{:clear } {:delay 54 00}{:clear }Next thing I knew, we were attacked...{:delay D3 00}{:clear }but I couldn´t see who it was--
his face was shrouded...in a black hood.
---
10205: The Organization!
---
10206: We found a way out of the cave...{:delay A2 00}{:clear }but the villain sent a horde of
terrible creatures after us...{:delay B4 00}{:clear } {:delay 42 00}{:clear }I´ve never seen their likes before...{:delay 60 00}{:clear } {:delay 60 00}{:clear }I think I´m the only one who
made it back to the ship...
---
10207: Will...
---
10208: Elizabeth...{:delay 3C 00}{:clear } {:delay 36 00}{:clear }I feel rather...
---
10209: Our turn, guys.
---
10210: You´d best go prepared. We´ve
no idea what´s out there.
---
10211: Pardon me, lads and lass,{:delay 72 00}{:clear }but your captain will have
no monsters today.{:delay AE 00}{:clear }Thank ye. We´re turning for home.
---
10212: Just like that?
---
10213: Just like that!
---
10214: Don´t remember invitin´ you.
---
10215: So it was the Organization.
We´ll handle this!
---
10216: The darkness of men´s hearts--drawn
to these cursed medallions;{:delay 13 01}{:clear }and this Heartless--a veritable maelstrom
of avarice: {:delay 1C 01}{:clear }I wonder, are they worthy to serve
Organization {XIII}?
---
10217: And you want an answer now?
---
10218: Precisely!
---
10219: Oh, boy!
---
10220: Not over yet!
---
10221: Throw him overboard!
---
10222: Aye aye!
---
10223: Parley!
---
10224: ´Scuse me?
---
10225: Barley?
---
10226: It´s a bit of a pirates´ code.{:delay 60 00}{:clear } {:delay 24 00}{:clear }Anyone who invokes "parley" must not be
harmed ´til negotiations are complete.
---
10227: This is no time for rules!
---
10228: True. But as we´re honorable pirates{:delay A2 00}{:clear }we should always stick to the Code.{:delay B4 00}{:clear }All right, you. Out with it!
---
10229: I surrender the chest
with my humblest apologies.
---
10230: Rather accommodating of you, mate.{:delay 84 00}{:clear }And for that you want...?
---
10231: Just a few souvenirs...for the memories.
---
10232: Huh?
---
10233: Oh, no!{:delay 38 00}{:clear }We can´t stop the curse unless
we got all the medallions!
---
10234: Our friend´s about to learn what
it means to cross a pirate.
---
10235: Oh?
---
10236: Sora! Donald! Goofy! He´s yours!
---
10237: Fire!
---
10238: You stole a medallion again!?
---
10239: Were I only that fortunate...
---
10240: Fortunate?
---
10241: So, uh, how come you´re all skeleton-y?
---
10242: Perhaps I got a touch o´ somethin´ from
that monster what attacked us.{:delay F0 00}{:clear }Yet, why´s the skin restin´
right on you three?
---
10243: ´Cause we´re not greedy!
---
10244: What´re you looking at?
---
10245: That still doesn´t solve the mystery.
---
10246: Gawrsh...{:delay 42 00}{:clear }Maybe the reason we´re all okay is
because we´re not from this world.
---
10247: There must be different laws.
---
10248: Yeah...{:delay 3C 00}{:clear }{:delay 36 00}{:clear }we´re always just passing through...
---
10249: Wonder when we´ll see home again...
---
10250: Sora...
---
10251: Just kiddin´ you.{:delay 6E 00}{:clear }Lucky we didn´t get cursed, huh?
---
10252: Quit yammerin´, mates!{:delay 4E 00}{:clear }We´ve got to find ourselves
a ship that´ll float.
---
10253: Look!
---
10254: A medallion! Get it!
---
10255: Three more to go!
---
10256: How do you know?
---
10257: A pirate must have a keen eye.{:delay 78 00}{:clear }Else he won´t be sailin´ free
for very long. Savvy?
---
10258: Huh? What´s that?
---
10259: Ahoy, mateys!
---
10260: Ridiculous imitation--
and yet, I´m flattered.
---
10261: {:unk13 58 01 8C 00}{:unk08 01 00 02}Jack, what happened!?
This is horrible!
---
10262: {:unk13 4E 01 39 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}Ah, but who´s to
blame for it, eh?
---
10263: {:unk13 EE 00 D7 00}{:unk08 01 00 01}Well, it certainly isn´t Elizabeth.
---
10264: {:unk13 62 01 6E 00}{:unk08 01 00 06}It´s Organization {XIII}.{:clear }They´re the ones
behind it all.
---
10265: {:unk13 D2 00 0A 01}{:unk08 01 01 01}Wonder where they went.
---
10266: {:unk13 94 00 AD 00}{:unk08 01 01 01}The hooded man took
the pirates and his
creatures with him{:clear }into some strange hole.{:clear }We saw them leave
from inside the
captain´s stateroom.
---
10267: {:unk13 0A 01 A6 00}{:unk08 01 01 02}Didn´t occur to you
to fight them, mate?
---
10268: {:unk13 8A 00 9C 00}{:unk08 01 01 01}I´m no fool.{:clear }I knew I was no
match for them.
---
10269: {:unk13 23 01 9D 00}{:unk08 01 01 02}That I believe.
---
10270: {:unk13 E3 00 39 00}{:unk08 01 00 04}Sora, I think we´ll
need your help.
---
10271: {:unk13 7F 01 5C 00}{:unk08 01 01 05}Got it.
---
10272: {:unk13 F2 00 39 00}{:unk08 01 00 04}First, let´s find
all the medallions.{:clear }Otherwise, the curse
can´t be broken...{:clear }and the creatures
will remain invincible.
---
10273: That´s four medallions!
We got ´em all!
---
10274: But where´s the chest?
---
10275: If we find the hooded
man, we´ll find it.
---
10276: Prob´ly in Port Royal.
---
10277: Why´s that?
---
10278: Organization {XIII} is after people´s hearts.{:delay AE 00}{:clear }So they´re gonna go
wherever there´s lots of people.
---
10279: They´ll hurt the townsfolk?
---
10280: No, they´re bringin´ ´em flowers, mate.{:delay A3 00}{:clear }I don´t know who these Organizers are,{:delay 8A 00}{:clear }but I will say they´re makin´ we
pirates look like proper gents.
---
10281: Well, Jack...{:delay 3C 00}{:clear }{:delay 54 00}{:clear }then...we have to help!
---
10282: Then let go and haul to run free!
---
10283: Go! He´s for me.
---
10284: Now to break that curse!
---
10285: The curse--it´s gone!
---
10286: Then what´s this?
---
10287: Aw, I understand.{:delay 7E 00}{:clear }Jack musta been cursed by that monster,
not from takin´ the gold.
---
10288: Oh, I´ve no worries, then.
---
10289: It´s okay, Jack.{:delay 42 00}{:clear }We´ll just have to defeat the monster,
that´s all.
---
10290: Get the gold!
---
10291: All better.
---
10292: Ah, not quite, mate.
---
10293: Sora, bravo.
---
10295: Just who was that chap?
---
10296: He´s part of an Organization that´s
collecting hearts.{:delay C0 00}{:clear }First they release Heartless
into different worlds.{:delay B4 00}{:clear }We defeat those Heartless.{:delay 72 00}{:clear }Then they get the hearts.{:delay 8A 00}{:clear }We´re never gonna stop ´em like this.
---
10297: What´s the plan, then?
---
10298: We´ve gotta find their stronghold and
finish them off once and for all.
---
10299: Sailin´ these waters, I´ve heard
some tales, but not a one like this.
---
10300: Is there any way we can help?
---
10301: 
---
10302: Anything at all?
---
10303: There is.
---
10304: It´s certain we don´t need the likes of that
hooded fellow and the Heartless about.{:delay 12 01}{:clear }They´ll ruin the market for us true pirates.
---
10305: So that´s why you went to Port Royal.{:delay 82 00}{:clear }And we thought you actually
wanted to save everyone.
---
10306: A pirate always looks to profit, Miss Swann.
---
10307: Too bad. You had us going there,
thinking you´d turned over a new leaf.
---
10308: The question is, what´s beyond the leaf?
Savvy?
---
10309: Oh...oh, yes--a reward. And what´ll it be?
---
10310: That lovely blade of Sora´s.
---
10311: Huh?
---
10312: Okay. Sure.
---
10313: Hold on! That was far too easy.{:delay A9 00}{:clear }What´s the rub?
---
10314: There, you see?
---
10315: Well, you´ve always got the Pearl, Jack.
---
10316: That I do.{:delay 50 00}{:clear }But someday, I´ll gather a blood-thirsty
crew, and come to take that blade.{:delay 1A 01}{:clear }Chance by then I´ll have
the way to wield it.
---
10317: And if I succeed, I´ll ask you two to
join me. That´d be reward enough.
---
10318: Done.
---
10319: Maybe someday, Jack´ll be able
to use the Keyblade after all.
---
10320: Why´s that?
---
10321: A-hyuck! He and Sora are
kind of alike, dontcha think?
---
10322: Are not!
---
10323: Some say Jack Sparrow´s the worst
pirate ever to sail the Spanish Main.
---
10324: No one could really mean that.
---
10325: Right. We know he´s the best.
---
10326: I hope we´ll get to see him again.
---
10427: Ah, but in the moonlight...
---
10431: It's an ambush! You'll have to defeat them all or escape within the ship!
---
10432: When Barbossa captured me,
I didn´t want him to find out{:clear }I was the Governor´s daughter.{:clear }That´s why I told him the name Turner.
I had no idea it would lead to all that!
---
14156: Defeat Barbossa with the help of Jack!
---
14157: Defeat Barbossa with the help of Jack!
Defeat the Heartless creating darkness,
then fight Barbossa!
Using magic will make the battle easier!
---
15191: One more medallion to go! Search for Nobodies in other areas!
---
15192: Two more medallions to go! Search for Nobodies in other areas!
---
15193: The Nobody has escaped!
---
15229: Defeat the Nobody and retrieve the medallion
before it escapes!
---
15230: Find the Nobody hiding in the dark
and retrieve the medallion!
---
15231: Find the Nobody in hiding
and retrieve the medallion!
---
15232: The Nobody will appear once all
the pirates have been defeated!
Using the moonlight will make
the battle easier!
---
15233: Defeat the Nobody and retrieve the medallion
before it escapes!
---
15234: Defeat the Nobody and retrieve the medallion
before it escapes!
---
15851: You want to catch the {:theme 0A}Black Pearl{:reset}, right?
If so, stop moseying around and let´s go.
---
15852: We´d better {:theme 0A}get back to Port Royal{:reset}.
We should be safe there.
---
15853: Hey! Keep your hands off my helm!
---
15854: I don´t trust pirates, either,
but I hope Jack´s all right.{:clear }First, we have to get Elizabeth back,
though, so let´s {:theme 0A}return to Port Royal{:reset}.
---
15855: Teaming up with Heartless...
that´s sinking pretty low even for pirates!{:clear }It looks like we have no choice now but to
settle things on Isla de Muerta!
---
15856: I´m sure Jack will be all right.{:clear }He seems to be the kind of guy who
can get out of any situation.
---
15857: Will was captured trying
to help us.{:clear }I know our enemies are lying in wait
for us, but we can´t just abandon him!
---
15858: Who knows where those guys might be?
We´ll just have to look everywhere!{:clear }I doubt they´re in town, though.
Hmm...I wonder where we should begin.
---
15859: The Nobodies stole four
medallions in total, right?{:clear }Hmm...I wonder where
they could be.
---
15860: If someone declares parley,
a pirate must cease hostilities and negotiate.{:clear }That´s just the way it is.
Even pirates have a code.
---
15861: We were knocked from the Black Pearl over
to the Interceptor by that Heartless.{:clear }If the Interceptor wasn´t so sturdy, we
would have sunk before winding up here.
---
15862: This seems to be where wrecked
ships drift to.{:clear }There may be a boat in good enough
condition to use. {:theme 0A}Let´s go look.{:reset}
---
15863: I´ll bet those Heartless from before
are waiting for us in town!{:clear }They´re using the power of the Aztec gold,
so we´ll need to rely on our magic again!
---
15864: Well, we have the medallions.
Now all that´s left to do is return them.{:clear }Organization {XIII} is probably in town, so
I´ll bet that´s where the chest is.
---
15865: It's an ambush! You'll have to defeat
them all or escape within the ship!
---
15900: I don´t want to hear about any
monsters or curses.{:clear }I´m taking this ship out,
so hurry to your posts.
---
15901: Jack doesn´t wanna help.{:clear }Still, we can´t just ignore Organization {XIII},
and we need a ship to travel on.
---
15902: So Organization {XIII} is now
in this world, huh?{:clear }They must be up to no good.
We´d better be on our guard.
---
15904: Do you want to try that
sliding plank again?
---
15905: Despite all that´s happened, I´m still
intrigued by a life on the high seas.{:clear }I think I´d like to do
some more traveling.
---
15916: Breezy, eh?
---
15917: I was worried for awhile there that Donald
might end up getting cursed by that gold.{:clear }I know he´ll be mad at me for thinking
that, but after all...he´s Donald!
---
15960: Please, let´s hurry after Will´s ship.
I fear for him.
---
15961: Those cursed medallions sure
caused us a lot of trouble!{:clear }And it´s all because people try to
steal treasure! Sheesh!
---
16669: {:unk13 B6 00 EB 00}{:unk08 01 00 01}Of course!{:clear }I´m Sora.
---
16670: {:unk13 BF 00 F5 00}{:unk08 01 00 01}This is Donald
and Goofy.
---
17009: {:unk13 97 01 46 00}{:unk08 01 00 06}Those pirates
were cursed.
---
17010: {:unk13 10 01 46 00}{:unk08 01 01 06}I thought we´d seen the last of
the curse of the Aztec gold...{:clear }What gives?
---
17011: {:unk13 3D 01 42 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}Wait, Jack!
I need your help.
---
17012: {:unk13 52 01 46 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}The cursed pirates
have returned. Will
had to find out why...{:clear }so he went to Isla
de Muerta--{:clear }to check on the
Aztec treasure.{:clear }I fear something´s
happened. You have
to take me to him.
---
17105: My bet is Barbossa´s on Isla de Muerta,
trying to lift the curse. We´d best hurry!
---
17106: Why am I going back to
Isla de Muerta...?
---
17107: We´ll probably need to sail all over the
blooming place for these medallions, eh?
---
17108: It´s back to the town then, eh? Once
you´re ready, we´d better get moving!
---
17109: I can´t believe Will went back to
{:theme 0A}Isla de Muerta{:reset}! What´s the big deal!?
---
17110: Elizabeth is so worried.
We´d better find Will soon.
---
17352: You dropped the medallion!
---
17353: The medallion was stolen! Retrieve it quickly!
---
17354: Retrieve the medallion quickly!
---
17426: Looks like Barbossa´s really gone
to town with the...uh...town.{:clear }Anyway, I´ve gotten all the information
I need, so I´m ready whenever you are.
---
17427: Will´s a blacksmith, and that
girl who was kidnapped is{:clear }the daughter of one of
his important customers.{:clear }If you ask me, though, Will seems more
like a swordsman than a blacksmith.
---
17428: Apparently that pirate who was with
Pete is called Barbossa.{:clear }People say he'll stop at nothing to get what
he wants, but I wonder what it is he's after.
---
17687: I've despised pirates all my life,
but some aren't so bad after all.{:clear }I'm grateful to all of you...even Jack.
---
17688: I´ve seen cursed pirates before,
so I can kind of understand.{:clear }Those members of Organization {XIII}
aren´t really people.{:clear }They´re...something else,
aren´t they?
---
18341: "For use in the event of a pirate attack.
-Commodore Norrington"
---
18342: "A Gift for the Pirates"
---
18343: "A symbol of peace and prosperity
in Port Royal."
---
18344: The rudder of the naval vessel, the Interceptor.
---
18345: This must be for use against pirates.
---
18346: Dangerous to operate, this cannon
was installed with great care.
---
18347: Plenty of rations are stored.
---
18348: This ship is obviously ready
for immediate combat.
---
18349: You can detect the faint smell
of grease and gunpowder.
---
18350: The rudder of the Black Pearl--
the fastest ship ever built.
---
18351: The bell is dented. Must be the rough
activity of the pirates.
---
18352: There are many beautiful ornaments...
but the treasure chest is empty.
---
18353: It's part of Barbossa's stolen treasure...
but the treasure chest is empty.
---
18354: It's part of Jack's stolen treasure...
but the treasure chest is empty.
---
18355: People who steal the medallions from
here are cursed with immortality.
---
18356: This is all that´s left of the Interceptor.
---
18405: This place is not accessible now.
---
18710: Use magical and physical attacks to
defeat the Heartless!
---
18711: Collect the medallions from
the Heartless with the use of magic!
Return them to the chest to help
defeat the Heartless!
---
18918: I found something strange. It´s a board
with wheels on it. Think you could use it?
---
18919: {:unk13 00 01 40 01}{:unk08 02 00 06}It looks kinda fun. Try it out?
{:chardelay 33 00}Um, maybe not.
{:chardelay 52 00}Sure, I´ll borrow it.
---
18920: {:unk13 00 01 40 01}{:unk08 02 00 06}It does resemble a skateboard.
Maybe I should?
{:chardelay 33 00}Um, maybe not.
{:chardelay 52 00}Sure, I´ll borrow it.
---
19109: Apparently this bell is used to announce
the passing of the hours.
---
19110: This ship is very well furnished
for a naval vessel. Hmmm.
---
19111: This cannon only proves
Barbossa´s hostile intentions.
---
19347: Return the medallions to the chest by using magic to collect them from the Heartless!
---
19348: The Heartless Boss is stealing the medallions! Stop him!
---
19619: Defeat the Heartless that is creating darkness!
---
19745:

19877:

20187: {:unk08 02 00 06}It's an Absent Silhouette, a shadowy presence
within an emblem.
{:chardelay 33 00}Who cares?
{:chardelay A1 00}Let's check it out!
---
20614: Press {:icon dynamic-triangle} to begin the duel! Find and attack her real form!
---
21548: {:delayandfade 07 B4} 
As Sora and his friends fend off the
pirates, Pete flees from the scene,
leaving them behind.
 
Determined to finish off the remaining
cursed pirates, they hurry into town.
 
 
 
 

---
21549: {:delayandfade 07 B4} 
They meet a young man named Will Turner,
who is on a mission to save Elizabeth,
the governor's daughter.
 
They all head to the port where the pirate
ship should be docked. They'd better hurry
if they want to catch her!
 
 
 

---
21550: {:delayandfade 07 B4} 
Sora and his friends make their way to
Isla de Muerta.
 
Jack, wanting to save the Black Pearl, and
Will, wanting to save Elizabeth, hurry off
the boat.
 
 
 
 

---
21551: {:delayandfade 07 B4} 
While the others head off to fulfill their
duties, Sora is told to wait quietly aboard
the ship.
 
But of course, the adventure-loving hero
ignores their words, and rushes to their
aid instead.
 
 
 

---
21552: {:delayandfade 07 B4} 
Sora and his friends return to the ship,
but they realize Jack is nowhere to be
seen. Where could the Captain be?
 
In response, Will begins to talk about the
chain of events that took place on the
island.
 
 
 

---
21553: {:delayandfade 07 B4} 
"Jack's no fairy-tale pirate. The real
ones aren't to be trusted."
 
Will utters those words with disdain.
 
Leaving Jack to fend for himself on
the island, Will steers the ship back to
Port Royal.
 
 

---
21554: {:delayandfade 07 B4} 
Sora and his friends become trapped in
the hold of the ship--a ship set with
explosives. Will they all be lost to Davy
Jones's locker!?
 
It looks like all hope is lost, but Jack's
cunning wisdom and Sora's courage
save the day.
 
 

---
21555: {:delayandfade 07 B4} 
Sora and his friends find themselves in
Port Royal once again--a world of
pirates, treasures, and great adventures.
 
However, the only thing they're met with
is something they're all too familiar
with: trouble.
 
 
 

---
21556: {:delayandfade 07 B4} 
The curse should have been lifted, but
cursed pirates still wander the streets.
Not only that, Will, who had gone to Isla
de Muerta to investigate, is missing.
 
Sora hops on the Black Pearl and heads
back out to sea.
 
 
 

---
21557: {:delayandfade 07 B4} 
The Organization can't get away with this
any longer!
 
But Sora doesn't challenge them--not yet.
The gang knows they don't have a fighting
chance without gathering all the
medallions.
 
After a long, hard chase...
