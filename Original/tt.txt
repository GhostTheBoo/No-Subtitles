Sometimes there´s more than one.

What else is there?

---
12180: {:unk13 18 01 46 00}{:unk06 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}That´s 1600 munny!
We need another 3200.
---
12181: {:unk13 18 01 46 00}{:unk06 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}Let´s find ourselves some

12184: {:unk13 D8 00 7B 00}{:unk06 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}Whatever. Those pretzels

13208: {:unk13 1B 01 60 00}{:unk08 01 01 06}Go on, Roxas,
ask her.
---
13209: {:unk13 BA 00 4B 00}{:unk08 01 01 06}Oh, it´s you, Roxas...
Please don´t let me down.{:clear }You used to be one of
my favorite customers.
---
13210: {:unk13 93 00 8A 00}{:unk08 01 01 06}I´m not a thief!
---
13211: {:unk13 13 01 4B 00}{:unk08 01 01 06}Okay...
---
13212: {:unk13 B2 00 7A 00}{:unk08 01 01 05}It´s no fun having everyone
suspecting me, ya know.
---
13213: {:unk13 CE 00 4B 00}{:unk08 01 01 06}Then you´ve got to find a
way to clear your name.{:clear }The woman at the candy shop
is pretty disappointed, too.
---
13214: {:unk13 FA 00 48 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}Roxas?{:clear }Have you seen
my cat around?
---
13215: {:unk13 C6 00 31 00}{:unk08 01 01 06}Er...
---
13216: {:unk13 F4 00 54 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}Thank you, Roxas.
---
13217: {:unk13 A2 00 3B 00}{:unk08 01 01 06}Did they steal something
from you, too?
---
13218: {:unk13 EF 00 45 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}Oh, my, yes.
Something important.
---
13219: {:unk13 A4 00 3B 00}{:unk08 01 01 06}Just so you know,
we didn´t do it.
---
13220: {:unk13 EC 00 54 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}I believe you.
---
13221: {:unk13 AB 00 3B 00}{:unk08 01 01 06}Thanks for
that, ma´am.{:clear }So what did they
take from you?
---
13222: {:unk13 EB 00 45 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}My ----.{:clear }My precious
----.
---
13223: {:unk13 25 01 ED 00}{:unk08 01 01 02}Looks like the culprit
is going around
stealing ----.
---
13224: {:unk13 26 01 3C 00}{:unk08 01 01 07}And not just
----,{:clear }but the word
----, too.
---
13225: {:unk13 87 01 FE 00}{:unk08 01 01 02}This isn´t your
average thief...
---
13226: {:unk13 24 01 60 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}I wonder if Seifer would
know anything about this.
---
13227: {:unk13 21 01 3B 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}We gotta talk to him.
C´mon, to the sandlot!
---
13228: Thieves.
---
13229: That was low, y´know!
---
13230: Oh yeah?
---
13231: Nice comeback there, blondie.
---
13232: What´d you say!?
---
13233: You can give us back
the ---- now.
---
13234: Yeah! You´re the only ones
who would take it, y´know?
---
13236: Replay!
---
13237: Now you´re talking!
---
13238: I guess if you get on your knees and beg,
MAYBE I´ll let it slide.
---
13240: Roxas!
---
13241: Roxas, focus!
---
13242: Come on...{:delay 48 00}{:clear } {:delay 22 00}{:clear }quit playin´ around and fight!
---
13243: 
---
13244: Seifer´s not feelin´ so hot, y´know!
---
13245: Tournament decides.
---
13247: What was that?
---
13248: The thief?
---
13249: 
---
13250: The righteous reign supreme, y´know?
---
13251: Shock!
---
13252: Whaddya doin´, y´know?!
---
13253: It´s the thief!?
---
13254: Get him!
---
13255: {:unk13 01 01 CE 00}We have come for you, my liege.
---
13256: 
---
13257: It´s no use...
---
13258: What?
---
13259: What...what is this thing?
---
13260: What´s this?
---
13261: I was his first customer after
he took over the shop.{:delay C0 00}{:clear }So we took a picture together.
---
13262: It´s a really nice photo.
---
13263: Oh...!
---
13264: Hey! You just said "photo"!
---
13265: So, Roxas, tell us about the picture thief.
---
13266: Not much to say.
The pictures were just lying there.
---
13267: Then how do we prove we weren´t
the ones who took ´em?
---
13268: It´s a GIRL...
---
13269: You look happy, Roxas.
---
13270: Do not.
---
13271: So, like, anybody else notice that{:delay 91 00}{:clear } all the stolen pictures are of Roxas?
---
13272: Ohh.{:delay 63 00}{:clear }So that´s why everyone thought it was us.
---
13273: You mean Seifer didn´t go around
accusing us after all?
---
13274: Are they really all of me?
---
13275: Yep.
---
13276: See?
---
13277: Look.
---
13278: Right? Every single one.
---
13279: Wouldn´t it be weird if the thief wanted
to steal the real Roxas or something?
---
13280: C´mon, get serious.{:delay 73 00}{:clear }Why would anyone wanna steal
a bonehead like Roxas?
---
13281: Oh, thanks!
---
13282: 
---
13283: Where...am I?
---
13284: Who´s there?
---
13285: Who are you?
---
13286: Restoration at 12%.
---
13287: Organization miscreants... They´ve found us.
---
13288: But...why would the Nobodies
steal photographs?
---
13289: Both are nothing but data to them.{:delay 76 00}{:clear } {:delay 32 00}{:clear }The fools could never tell the difference.{:delay AE 00}{:clear } {:delay 75 00}{:clear }We are running out of time.{:delay 82 00}{:clear } {:delay 53 00}{:clear }Naminé must make haste.
---
13290: Right... "Promise"...
---
13291: What a mess...
---
13292: {:unk13 22 01 50 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}Hurry to the sandlot!
You´re gonna be late!
---
13293: Who´re ya gonna root for?
---
13294: Both of them, silly.
---
13295: Ladies and gentlemen,
Struggle-fiends of Twilight Town!{:delay D7 00}{:clear }It´s time for summer´s most sizzling clash!
---
13296: That´s right!
Today is the day for the Struggle{:delay 12 01}{:clear }and title match!
---
13297: Who will be the one to
break through the ranks{:delay 87 00}{:clear }and take on our champion,
Setzer!?
---
13298: Seifer, y´know?
---
13299: And who will leave today as our
new Struggle Champion!?
---
13300: Hayner! Roxas!
---
13301: Setzerrr!
---
13302: Yes, the crowd is fired up, 
so you know what comes next:
---
13303: Let´s...
---
13304: STRUGGLE!
---
13305: Hey, now.
It´s time to introduce today´s combatants!{:delay DD 00}{:clear } {:delay 0E 00}{:clear }The four bad boys who struggled
their way through the preliminaries!
---
13306: Regular finalist and head of the
Twilight Disciplinary Committee: Seifer!
---
13307: Completely out of nowhere--{:delay 81 00}{:clear }who knew he´d make it so far THIS year? Vivi!
---
13308: An underground favorite and
local attitude problem: Hayner!{:delay F0 00}{:clear }It´s his first trip to the finals!
---
13309: And Struggler number four,{:delay 54 00}{:clear }who happens to be my absolute
favorite customer: Roxas!
---
13310: So, who will win this
sweltering summer Struggle!?
---
13311: AND...{:delay 1E 00}{:clear }a chance to take on our
defending champion, Setzer!
---
13312: It won´t be long now, folks.{:delay 5D 00}{:clear }I suggest our challengers go over the
official Struggle Rules before we begin!
---
13313: {:unk13 44 01 58 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}You already know the rules,
but a refresher can´t hurt.
---
13314: Hey... {:delay 28 00}{:clear }Sorry about yesterday.
---
13315: What, you still worried about that?{:delay 78 00}{:clear }You need to learn to let that stuff go.
---
13316: I´ve got a lot on my mind.
---
13317: Sorry, man.
---
13318: Wait, what am I sorry for?
---
13319: Our first match of today's Struggle
tournament will be between{:delay E0 00}{:clear }Roxas and his best friend, Hayner!
---
13320: And the winner is Roxas!
---
13321: Not even friendship will slow
this kid down.{:delay 9B 00}{:clear }And Hayner put up a great fight, too.
---
13322: I lost.{:delay 64 00}{:clear }Awww, I can´t believe it!
---
13323: I guess I taught you well.
---
13324: I had a lot of fun fighting you.
---
13325: Yeah, well I didn´t, wise guy.
---
13326: Hey, let´s find a way to cheer you up.
---
13327: Nah, that´s all right.
---
13328: Out of the way.
---
13329: You in a rush to lose?
---
13330: Don´t mess with your elders.
---
13331: Whew, just look at those sparks fly!{:delay A8 00}{:clear }I guess Seifer didn´t expect
to fight one of his own boys!
---
13332: When did Vivi get so tough?
---
13333: You´re mine!
---
13334: I-I´m not sure what just happened...
---
13335: Um...but...the winner is Vivi!{:delay EB 00}{:clear }In a positively blistering comeback!
---
13336: That´s not Vivi.
---
13337: Huh?
---
13338: Thrash ´im.
---
13339: It looks like Seifer´s withdrawn from
the Struggle for third place.
---
13340: So I´m in third now?{:delay 64 00}{:clear } {:delay 14 00}{:clear }Aw, baby!
---
13341: Keep it clean, fellas.
---
13342: And now, the match you´ve been waiting for:
Roxas vs. Vivi!
---
13343: Again!?
---
13344: Again...
---
13345: Roxas. All right.
Fight fight fight.
---
13346: You really don´t remember?{:delay 7A 00}{:clear } {:delay 14 00}{:clear }It´s me.{:delay 46 00}{:clear } {:delay 0A 00}{:clear }You know, Axel.
---
13347: Axel?
---
13348: Talk about blank with a capital "B."{:delay 93 00}{:clear } {:delay 14 00}{:clear }Man oh man, even the Dusks aren´t gonna
crack this one.
---
13349: Wait a sec, tell me what´s going on!
---
13350: This town is his creation, right?{:delay A3 00}{:clear } {:delay 14 00}{:clear }Which means we don´t have time for a
Q & A.{:delay A5 00}{:clear } {:delay 17 00}{:clear }You´re coming with me,
conscious or not.{:delay A6 00}{:clear }Then you´ll hear the story.
---
13351: Uh-oh.
---
13352: What´s going ON!?
---
13353: Number 13. Roxas.{:delay BE 00}{:clear } {:delay 14 00}{:clear }The Keyblade´s chosen one.
---
13354: Okay, fine!{:delay 55 00}{:clear }You asked for it!
---
13355: 
---
13356: So it was you.
---
13357: Roxas, this man speaks nonsense!
---
13358: Roxas, don´t let him deceive you!
---
13359: Roxas!
---
13360: Roxas!
---
13361: Hayner... {:delay 5A 00}{:clear }Pence... {:delay 55 00}{:clear }Olette...
---
13362: Hayner! Pence! Olette!
---
13363: What?
What just happened?
---
13364: {:delay 0A 00}{:clear }Huh? {:delay 0A 00}{:clear } {:delay 82 00}{:clear }...How did I get here?
---
13365: Roxas!
---
13366: Ladies and gentlemen, Roxas--{:delay 9E 00}{:clear }our new top Struggler!
---
13367: Roxas?
---
13368: Setzerrr!
---
13369: Roxas! It´s starting!
---
13370: You two, play fair now.
You´re at the top of the bracket.
---
13371: There´s only room for one up here.
---
13372: Well, may the best man win!
---
13373: Hey. Rucksack.{:delay 7E 00}{:clear } {:delay 14 00}{:clear }How about you throw the match for me?
---
13374: Roxas! Focus!
---
13375: Let me win, and I´ll make it worth your while.
---
13376: Get real.
---
13377: Roxas, our underdog hero, versus Setzer,
our defending champion!{:delay 0E 01}{:clear } {:delay 1B 00}{:clear }The winner of this match will be
the true champion!{:delay B4 00}{:clear } {:delay 16 00}{:clear }That´s bragging rights for a whole year, folks!
---
13378: Thanks for the win, partner.
This is for you.
---
13379: Roxas! Roxas!
---
13380: Roxas!
---
13381: You did it!
---
13382: That was awesome, Roxas!
---
13383: Roxas! Roxas!
---
13384: As promised.
---
13385: Thanks a ton, Roxas!
---
13386: One more treasure for us to share.
---
13387: I´ve got a present, too...for all of us.
---
13388: Whoa!
---
13389: Naminé...?
What´s happening to me?
---
13390: Who are you?
And that´s not my name.{:delay 9A 00}{:clear }I´m Kairi.
---
13391: Kairi... I know you.{:delay 78 00}{:clear }{:delay 28 00}{:clear }You´re that girl he likes.
---
13392: Who?
---
13393: Please, a name!
---
13394: I´m Roxas.
---
13395: Okay, Roxas,
but can you tell me HIS name?
---
13396: You don´t remember my name?{:delay 64 00}{:clear }Thanks a lot, Kairi!
---
13397: 
---
13398: O-kay,
I guess I can give you a hint.
---
13399: Starts with an "S"!
---
13400: His progress is astounding.
---
13401: So what happened?
---
13402: Naminé´s encounter with Roxas{:delay 78 00}{:clear } {:delay 05 00}{:clear }put his heart in contact
with Kairi´s.{:delay AA 00}{:clear } {:delay 4F 00}{:clear }And that, in turn, affected Sora.{:delay BF 00}{:clear } {:delay 1E 00}{:clear }You see?
---
13403: Naminé...{:delay 5A 00}{:clear } {:delay 1E 00}{:clear }She´s a wonder.
---
13404: She wasn´t born like other Nobodies.{:delay 96 00}{:clear } {:delay 3F 00}{:clear }She can interfere with the hearts and
memories of Sora and those aligned with him.
---
13405: But whose Nobody is she?
---
13406: I could tell you... {:delay 8B 00}{:clear } {:delay 33 00}{:clear }But first, perhaps you could
tell me your true name?
---
13407: It´s Ansem.
---
13408: {:delay D7 00}{:clear } {:delay 76 00}{:clear }It´s an honor, Ansem!
---
13409: I´m dreaming...
---
13410: But which parts...
were the dream?
---
13411: Only three days left of summer vacation,{:delay 8E 00}{:clear }so don´t even mention that assignment!
---
13412: But we agreed we´d get it finished today.
---
13413: Yesterday...{:delay 38 00}{:clear }I fell off the station tower, didn´t I?
---
13414: You wouldn´t be here if you did!
---
13415: But man, that was a close one...
---
13416: Stop changing the subject!
---
13417: Okay, already!
---
13418: You win. We´ll do the homework.{:delay 91 00}{:clear }Stupid independent study.{:delay 6F 00}{:clear } {:delay 0A 00}{:clear }So, anybody got any bright ideas for a topic?
---
13419: Maybe we could study the stuff
that´s happening to me.{:delay EB 00}{:clear } {:delay 0A 00}{:clear }You know, the dreams,
and the guys in white...
---
13420: Forget it.
---
13421: Why?
---
13422: You know, things have been weird
with you and the town{:delay 9A 00}{:clear } {:delay 0A 00}{:clear }since the photos were stolen, right?
---
13423: Well, tomorrow, we´re all gonna search
the town and find out what´s been goin´ on.
---
13424: Lots of people are helping out.
---
13425: All that for me?
---
13426: I´ll go get some ice cream!
---
13427: {:unk13 EA 00 87 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}There´s this strange
rumor going around.{:clear }Wanna hear it?
---
13428: {:unk13 AE 00 4E 00}{:unk08 01 01 06}You know the stone steps
at Sunset Station?
---
13429: {:unk13 B5 00 51 00}{:unk06 01}{:unk08 01 01 06}We use ´em all the time,
without even thinking about it.{:clear }But--and this is
the weird part--{:clear }the steps count different
going up and down!
---
13430: {:unk13 0B 01 50 00}{:unk06 02}{:unk08 03 00 05}Seriously!?
---
13431: {:unk13 49 01 79 00}{:unk08 01 01 05}And there are six other
weird stories like that.{:clear }It´s like...{:clear }the seven wonders
of Twilight Town.
---
13432: {:unk13 40 01 50 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}We should investigate those
for our school project!{:clear }Pence, you´re a genius!
---
13433: {:unk13 E6 00 50 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}There might be other
rumors going around, too.{:clear }Let´s split up!{:clear }I´m gonna look for
the seven wonders...
---
13434: {:unk13 33 01 56 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}Olette and I will go
find some new rumors!{:clear }C´mon!
---
13435: {:unk13 22 01 50 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}That leaves you
and me, Roxas.{:clear }Let´s try the train first.
To the station!
---
13436: The time has come! Our hunt
for the seven wonders begins!
---
13437: Whoa! Find new rumors already?
---
13438: Nothing on Market Street.
---
13439: You twerps aren´t
gonna scoop us.{:delay 8C 00}{:clear } {:delay 1E 00}{:clear } We´re going to the terrace with you.
---
13440: Hayner, it´s not a race!
---
13441: Well, it is now!
---
13442: C´mon, we can all go.
---
13443: Hey... What´d I do with it?
---
13444: Olette! Hurry!
---
13445: Huh.
---
13446: Aren´t these the steps you talked about?{:delay 64 00}{:clear } {:delay 50 00}{:clear }The ones that count different
going up and down?
---
13447: Umm...actually, it´s the
stupidest thing ever, but...
---
13448: What?
---
13449: Rai´s the one who counted.{:delay 64 00}{:clear } {:delay 0C 00}{:clear }He´s like, "Every time I count, it´s
different, Y´KNOW?" Ha ha ha ha!
---
13450: So...he just counted wrong?
---
13451: Hey, no worries.
---
13452: You know...{:delay 4B 00}{:clear }that last wonder wasn´t
exactly wonderful.
---
13453: I understand, say no more.
---
13454: But this next one´s gonna
be really great!{:delay 90 00}{:clear }Wonder number Six!
---
13455: We got another lead!
---
13456: "The Ghost Train Mystery"...
---
13457: Everybody knows about Wonder number Six!
---
13458: Yeah, well, I didn´t.
---
13459: Did you find out where the train runs?
---
13460: You can see it from Sunset Hill.
---
13461: If the rumors are true,
it´ll be here any minute...
---
13462: For they say the train is empty.{:delay A5 00}{:clear } {:delay 18 00}{:clear } No driver,{:delay 3C 00}{:clear } {:delay 1A 00}{:clear }no conductor,{:delay 41 00}{:clear } {:delay 1F 00}{:clear } no passengers...{:delay 47 00}{:clear } {:delay 18 00}{:clear }NO RETURN.
---
13463: We´ve gotta make it to the beach next year.
---
13464: Yeah. We better get jobs
the second vacation starts.
---
13465: Good afternoon, slackers.{:delay 6E 00}{:clear } {:delay 20 00}{:clear } What are you doing out here?
---
13466: What do you care?
---
13467: I don´t. Tell me anyway.
---
13468: We´re waiting for the ghost train.
---
13469: Waiting for the ghost train!
---
13470: Why does looking at you
always tick me off?
---
13471: I dunno.{:delay 46 00}{:clear } {:delay 24 00}{:clear }Maybe it´s destiny.
---
13472: Destiny...{:delay 4A 00}{:clear }In that case, let´s be friends.
---
13473: I don´t feel like cooperating
with destiny.
---
13474: When have you ever cooperated with anything?
---
13475: Seifer?
---
13476: I know.{:delay 3C 00}{:clear } {:delay 14 00}{:clear }Tomorrow.
---
13477: Look!
---
13478: It´s really true...
---
13479: And there´s really no one aboard!
---
13480: What´s the catch?
There´s gotta be a catch, right?
---
13481: Then it´s real!?
---
13482: Let´s go to the station!
---
13483: Let´s go in!
---
13484: What!?
---
13485: Um...you´ll get hurt.
---
13486: Huh?
---
13487: The train will be arriving shortly.
---
13488: C´mon.
---
13489: A train came from the beach.{:delay 84 00}{:clear }There was no driver, right?
---
13490: Let´s go...
---
13491: Right!?
---
13492: Let´s go home and work on the paper.
---
13493: "The rumors were bogus. The end."
---
13494: We can still make it sound good if
we write about all the work we did.
---
13495: But what about the last one--
the seventh wonder?
---
13496: Who cares?
---
13497: I do. C´mon, Pence.
---
13498: Whatever!
---
13499: Roxas...
---
13500: {:delay 54 00}{:clear }It´s at that haunted mansion.
---
13501: You know something...
---
13502: Whoa!
---
13503: We were gonna check the
mansion out tomorrow.
---
13504: Right...
---
13505: Even Seifer´s gang was gonna help.
---
13506: Seifer?
---
13507: Yeah, Hayner asked him to.
---
13508: So what´re we lookin´ for?
---
13509: Well, they say there´s a girl who
appears at the second floor window...{:delay 10 01}{:clear }even though no one´s lived here for years.
---
13510: Roxas...
---
13511: Naminé?
---
13512: This is...{:delay 3C 00}{:clear }{:delay 33 00}{:clear }me?{:delay 45 00}{:clear } {:delay 5D 00}{:clear }...And Axel´s here too.
---
13513: You ARE best friends...
---
13514: Very funny.
---
13515: Don´t you want to know the truth
about who you really are?
---
13516: No one knows me better than me.
---
13517: Of course...
---
13518: But...I don´t get what´s
been happening lately.
---
13519: You know these three, don´t you?
---
13520: Yeah. Sora, Donald, and Goofy.{:delay E6 00}{:clear } {:delay 2D 00}{:clear } They´re from the dreams.
---
13521: About a year ago...{:delay 6C 00}{:clear } {:delay 1E 00}{:clear }some things happened,{:delay 92 00}{:clear }and I had to take apart the memories
chained together in Sora´s heart. {:delay CD 00}{:clear } {:delay 3A 00}{:clear }But now...I´m putting them all back
exactly the way they were.
---
13522: You mean...the dreams?
---
13523: Yes...{:delay 3C 00}{:clear } {:delay 24 00}{:clear }You and Sora are connected.
---
13524: And...in order for Sora to become
completely whole again...
---
13525: Me? What for?
---
13526: You hold half of what he is...{:delay 9B 00}{:clear } {:delay 82 00}{:clear }He needs you, Roxas.
---
13527: Naminé?
---
13528: Naminé...who are you?
---
13529: I´m a witch with power over Sora´s
memories and those around him.
---
13530: A witch?
---
13531: That´s what DiZ called me.
---
13532: Hmm...I can´t help you there.
---
13533: It´s funny...{:delay 5A 00}{:clear } {:delay 64 00}{:clear }Suddenly I feel like I
don´t know myself at all...
---
13534: You...{:delay 3C 00}{:clear } {:delay 50 00}{:clear }you were never supposed to exist, Roxas.
---
13535: What...?{:delay 5A 00}{:clear } {:delay 29 00}{:clear } How could you even say such a thing...{:delay 93 00}{:clear } {:delay 2B 00}{:clear }even if it were true?
---
13536: I´m sorry.{:delay 3C 00}{:clear } {:delay 23 00}{:clear } I guess some things...{:delay 50 00}{:clear }really are better left unsaid.
---
13537: Roxas! Roxas!
---
13538: Huh?
---
13539: Did you see her?
---
13540: Yeah. Watch the window--closely.
---
13541: Oh, lame.
---
13542: ...Yeah.
---
13543: Well, let´s head back to the usual spot.{:delay B8 00}{:clear } Hayner and Olette are waiting.
---
13544: Hey guys, how´d it go?
---
13545: The girl in the window turned out to
be a curtain flapping in the wind.
---
13546: I figured as much.
The report´s already done.
---
13547: All right!
---
13548: So, wanna go find Hayner?{:delay 78 00}{:clear }He´s probably at the station.
---
13549: You know...we only have
two more days together.
---
13550: Huh?
---
13551: Summer vacation, remember?
---
13552: Oh...{:delay 64 00}{:clear }right.
---
13553: Tomorrow we search the town.
---
13554: Next day´s the fair.
---
13555: The last day of summer.
---
13556: Don´t say that!
You´ll give me an ulcer!
---
13557: Not if you explode from
all that ice cream first.
---
13558: Why did you show him the train?
---
13559: Because he missed the trip to the beach.
---
13560: Hmph...that´s almost kind of you.
---
13561: Now...{:delay 50 00}{:clear } {:delay 1E 00}{:clear }what about you?{:delay 4B 00}{:clear } {:delay 39 00}{:clear }Are the holes in your memory
starting to fill in?
---
13562: Yes...the haze is clearing.
---
13563: The same thing is happening to everyone
who had ties to Sora.{:delay 0E 01}{:clear } {:delay 6E 00}{:clear }Very soon, to them, he´ll
be like a good friend{:delay B6 00}{:clear }who´s gone away for a year.
---
13564: I´ve waited, and now I want to know.{:delay 7D 00}{:clear } {:delay 32 00}{:clear }What is it that you want?
---
13565: Revenge.
---
13566: Revenge...
---
13567: Now, for the finishing touches.{:delay BA 00}{:clear } {:delay 0A 00}{:clear } First, we must dispose of Naminé.{:delay B4 00}{:clear } {:delay 0A 00}{:clear }She did a splendid job with Sora,
but it´s high time she disappeared.
---
13568: Restoration at 97%.
---
13569: Man, I could not sleep last night...
---
13570: Guys?
---
13571: Look at what it´s come to.{:delay 78 00}{:clear }I´ve been given these icky orders to
destroy you{:delay A1 00}{:clear } {:delay 1E 00}{:clear }if you refuse to come back with me.
---
13572: We´re...{:delay 56 00}{:clear }best friends, right?
---
13573: Sure...but I´m not getting turned into
a Dusk for...{:delay EC 00}{:clear }Wait a sec! You remember now!?
---
13574: Y-yeah.
---
13575: Great!{:delay 38 00}{:clear }But, you know, gotta make sure and all.{:delay A4 00}{:clear }So, umm...{:delay 78 00}{:clear } {:delay 73 00}{:clear }What´s our boss´s name?
---
13576: Can´t believe this...
---
13577: Roxas, to the mansion!{:delay C2 00}{:clear }The time has come!
---
13578: Hayner!{:delay 58 00}{:clear }Pence!{:delay 63 00}{:clear }Olette!
---
13579: The Roxas that I know is long gone.
---
13580: Don´t call me and then lock me out...
---
13581: Organization {XIII}...{:delay 6F 00}{:clear }they´re a bad group.
---
13582: Bad or good, I don´t know.{:delay E5 00}{:clear }They´re a group of incomplete people
who wish to be whole.{:delay C8 00}{:clear } {:delay 30 00}{:clear }To that end, they´re desperately
searching for something.
---
13583: What?
---
13584: Kingdom Hearts.
---
13585: Funny?
---
13587: You are...
---
13588: Naminé!
---
13589: There´s no knowledge that has the
power to change your fate.
---
13590: Even if it doesn´t, I wanna know.{:delay B0 00}{:clear }I have the right to know!
---
13591: A Nobody doesn´t have a right to know.{:delay D1 00}{:clear }Nor does it even
have the right to be.
---
13592: But what IS a Nobody!?
---
13593: DiZ, we´re out of time.
Too many Nobodies!
---
13594: Roxas.
Nobodies like us are only half a person.{:delay 29 01}{:clear }You won´t disappear.{:delay 85 00}{:clear }You´ll be whole!
---
13595: I´ll...disappear...?
---
13596: No further outbursts!
---
13597: No, you WON´T disappear!
---
13598: Wait!
---
13600: Let her go!
---
13601: Naminé!
---
13602: Will it work?
---
13603: If we can maintain the simulated town
until Naminé finishes{:delay 0D 01}{:clear }chaining together Sora´s memories.
---
13604: What will happen to Roxas?
---
13605: He holds half of Sora´s power within him.{:delay F7 00}{:clear }In the end, he´ll have to give it back.{:delay 79 00}{:clear } {:delay 3C 00}{:clear }Until then, he´ll need another personality
to throw off his pursuers.
---
13606: Poor thing.
---
13607: It´s the fate of a Nobody.
---
13608: Simply amazing, Roxas.
---
13609: Axel.
---
13610: You really do remember me this time?{:delay D3 00}{:clear }I´m SO FLATTERED.
---
13611: But you're too late!!!
---
13612: Two!?
---
13613: Axel...
---
13614: Let´s meet again in the next life.
---
13615: Yeah. I´ll be waiting.
---
13616: Silly.{:delay 8E 00}{:clear } Just because you have a next life...
---
13617: ...Donald?
---
13618: ...Goofy?
---
13619: At last, the Keyblade´s chosen one.
---
13620: Who are you talking to?{:delay 54 00}{:clear } {:delay 25 00}{:clear } Me?{:delay 3C 00}{:clear }Or Sora?
---
13621: To half of Sora, of course.{:delay A0 00}{:clear } {:delay 32 00}{:clear } You reside in darkness.{:delay 92 00}{:clear } {:delay 37 00}{:clear } What I need is{:delay 3C 00}{:clear }someone who can move about the realm of light
and destroy Organization {XIII}.
---
13622: Why? Who are you?
---
13623: I am a servant of the world.
---
13625: And, if I´m a servant,{:delay 77 00}{:clear }then you should consider yourself
a tool, at best.
---
13626: Was that...{:delay 63 00}{:clear }Was that supposed to be a joke?
---
13627: ´Cause I´m not laughing!
---
13628: My apologies.{:delay 3F 00}{:clear } {:delay 45 00}{:clear } This is only a data-based projection.
---
13629: Come, over here.
---
13630: I hate you so much...
---
13631: You should share some of that hatred
with Sora.{:delay EF 00}{:clear } He´s far too nice for his own good.
---
13632: No!{:delay 56 00}{:clear } My heart belongs to me!
---
13633: Sora...
---
13634: You´re lucky.
---
13635: Looks like my summer vacation is...{:delay 91 00}{:clear } {:delay 35 00}{:clear }over.
---
13636: Hey, what is this place?
---
13637: 
---
13638: You okay?
---
13639: What...?
---
13640: You and that dog came flying
out of a hole in the wall.{:delay B4 00}{:clear }{:delay 1E 00}{:clear }You nearly gave us heart attacks!
---
13641: H-help! The sandlot! It´s Seifer!
---
13642: Somebody please help us!
---
13643: Sounds like we´ve got trouble!
---
13644: We´ll take it from here!
---
13645: Impressive.
---
13646: By the way, have you seen
a man named Axel?{:delay 02 01}{:clear }I expect he´s here somewhere.
---
13647: Like I care.
---
13648: You see, Axel´s no longer acting
in our best interest.
---
13649: Is he with the Organization, too?
---
13650: Yes.
---
13651: You havin´ a fight?
---
13652: Not a very organized Organization...
---
13653: Don´t let your guard down.{:delay 96 00}{:clear }Axel will stop at nothing
to turn you into a Heartless.
---
13654: Gee, thanks for looking out
for us, mister.{:delay 96 00}{:clear }But I´m sure we can take care
of ourselves just fine.
---
13655: Glad to hear it.{:delay 8A 00}{:clear }Axel aside, it would break our hearts
to hear something happened to you.
---
13656: Hearts? You don´t have any hearts!
---
13657: True, we don´t have hearts.{:delay 8C 00}{:clear } {:delay 28 00}{:clear }But we remember what it was like.
That´s what makes us special.
---
13658: Whaddaya mean?
---
13659: We know very well how to injure a heart.
---
13660: Sora, you just keep on
fighting those Heartless.
---
13661: Let´s jump in after him!
---
13662: How come?
---
13663: I´m not sure, but maybe he´ll lead
us to the Organization´s world.
---
13664: Don´t be reckless. Do you
want to end up like Riku?
---
13665: What!?
---
13666: Hey, wait!
---
13667: What did he mean, end up like Riku?
---
13668: Hey, how ´bout you get out of my town now?
You´ve caused enough trouble.
---
13669: Riku...
---
13670: Have it your way! C´mon, guys.
---
13671: Hold it!
---
13672: Make up your mind!
---
13673: This goes to the strongest guy
in Twilight Town.
---
13674: Thanks, but...we don´t really need it.
---
13675: Oh! Sora!
---
13676: Um...Pence, right?
---
13677: Do you know a girl named Kairi?
---
13678: K-Kairi!? I sure do!
---
13679: Then you better come to the station!
---
13680: He-ey!
---
13681: Hey, so how do you guys know Kairi?
---
13682: Kairi was really here!?
---
13683: Yeah. And...she said she was looking for you.
---
13684: Tell me where she is!
---
13685: Well...
---
13686: What a romantic story!
---
13687: If you stick around, Sora´s bound to show up.
---
13688: Yeah, he said he´s coming back.
---
13689: Okay!
---
13690: What took you so long, Kairi?
---
13691: Somehow I just knew you´d be here.
---
13693: Kairi...
---
13694: Ya think it mighta been Axel?
---
13695: Sorry...
---
13696: Hey, it´s not your fault. C´mon, cheer up!
---
13697: Like I can even say that...
---
13698: I gotta help Kairi!
---
13701: That was close!
---
13702: Sora!?
---
13703: Sora! Are you okay?
---
13704: Huh? What...?
---
13705: Wh-what just happened?
---
13706: A new road is open.{:delay 72 00}{:clear }And Kairi and Riku are waiting
somewhere along it.
---
13707: You´d better hurry, then.
---
13708: You comin´ back?
---
13709: Promise!
---
13725: Hey! I think we´re almost there!
---
13726: 
---
13728: Gawrsh, aren´t we here
because of the picture?
---
13729: Look, I´ll show ya!
---
13730: Yeah! Goofy´s right!
---
13731: C´mon, let´s go find this mansion!
---
13732: Yeah!
---
13733: Hey, are you all right?
---
13734: What happened?
---
13735: We came here looking for Kairi.{:delay AA 00}{:clear }Then those white things attacked us...
---
13736: You gotta be careful!
---
13737: Yeah, you guys didn´t have to go and do that.
---
13738: Of course we did.
Kairi´s our friend, too, ya know.
---
13739: You´re right...{:delay 50 00}{:clear }You know, I never thought
of it like that before.
---
13740: Word is, this mansion gets a
lot of really strange visitors.
---
13741: We thought this place might be the gateway
to some kind of alternate Twilight Town.
---
13742: What do you mean, alternate Twilight Town?
---
13743: Hey, Goofy, do you think we could
see that crystal of yours?
---
13744: I made that pouch myself, and I still have it.{:delay 8A 00}{:clear }So there shouldn´t be two of them here.
---
13745: And this is the trophy Seifer gave you.{:delay AA 00}{:clear }You left it behind, remember?
---
13746: It´s the only one of its kind.{:delay 78 00}{:clear }Same for the crystals--red, blue,
yellow, green--only one of each color.{:delay A4 01}{:clear }But you´ve got your own!
---
13747: So...where´d you get it?
---
13748: 
---
13749: The pouch is from the King.{:delay 96 00}{:clear }When he gave us munny for the train ride,
he gave us the crystal too.
---
13750: But then...where did the KING get it?
---
13751: See? There´s gotta be another
town out there like this one.{:delay F0 00}{:clear }That would explain how the King
got that pouch and the crystal.{:delay AF 00}{:clear }Everything makes sense.
---
13752: It...does?
---
13753: That other town must be where
whatever´s missing from here went!
---
13754: Like Kairi.
---
13755: I get it!
---
13756: Watch out!
---
13757: I got somethin´ to tell ya.
I found out where Ansem is--{:delay B4 00}{:clear }Ansem the Wise! The real Ansem!{:delay 97 00}{:clear }He snuck into Organization {XIII}´s stronghold.
---
13758: And we´ve figured out where Kairi is!
I´m pretty sure we´re right.
---
13759: But why´d you all come here?
---
13760: Someone gave us a clue.
---
13761: Who?
---
13762: Well, Your Majesty,
Sora thinks it mighta been Riku.
---
13763: It´s just a feeling I had.
---
13764: Welp, if that´s what ya think,
then it´s probably right.
---
13765: You mean Riku´s okay!
---
13766: If that´s what ya think...
---
13767: I´ve waited long enough, Your Majesty!
Tell me what you know!
---
13768: It´s not for me to say.
---
13769: But Your Majesty! Why?
---
13770: I don´t wanna break my promise.
---
13771: You made a promise to Riku!?
---
13772: So he´s okay! I can see him again!
---
13773: Huh? Who´s Riku?
---
13774: My best friend.
---
13775: That´s IT!
---
13776: Your Majesty? You got the pouch with
the crystal from Riku, didn´t you?
---
13777: And you promised not to tell, right?
---
13778: Gosh, guys...
---
13779: That´s enough!
---
13780: Yeah. Let´s go!
---
13781: Kairi! Riku! We´re on our way!
---
13782: {:unk13 AA 00 C3 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}There´s gotta be a
computer somewhere.
---
13783: {:unk13 71 01 93 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}A computer...{:clear }Do you think it´s
connected to that
other Twilight Town?
---
13784: {:unk13 C1 00 B3 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}It might be.{:clear }And there should be a way into
the realm of darkness there.
---
13785: {:unk13 13 01 3D 00}{:unk08 01 00 04}Riku told you that,
didn´t he!?
---
13786: {:unk13 FC 00 50 01}{:unk08 01 01 03}Please, Sora.
I made a promise.
---
13787: {:unk13 DB 00 3B 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}Aha!
I knew it!

13788: {:unk13 CF 00 5C 01}{:unk06 02}{:unk08 03 01 01}Hey! Stop pestering
the King!

13789: {:unk13 BB 00 3F 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}Right. Sorry...
---
13790: There!
---
13791: We found it!
---
13792: How does it work?
---
13793: I can handle it.
---
13794: Okay...
---
13795: Here we go...
---
13796: Ah!
---
13797: What´s wrong?
---
13798: I can´t go any further without a password.
---
13799: Do ya have any idea what
the password might be?
---
13800: 
---
13801: Well, we only got this photo...
---
13802: 
---
13803: And the salty-sweet ice cream bar!
---
13804: Yeah, the one Donald ate up.
---
13805: It was in the box right next to the photo.
---
13806: Hey, that´s it!{:delay 50 00}{:clear }Ansem the Wise loved
ice cream!
---
13807: Okay, what´s the name of the flavor?
---
13808: No, that's not it.
Try to remember.
---
13809: It worked!
---
13810: Let´s go!
---
13811: We´ll be here to hold down the fort.
---
13812: Say hi to Kairi!
---
13813: You bet!
---
13814: Are we back in the same place?
---
13815: Look!
---
13816: This is the other Twilight Town.{:delay A0 00}{:clear }Roxas´s Twilight Town.
---
13817: There´s gotta be an entrance into
the dark realm somewhere.{:delay B4 00}{:clear }Let´s split up.
---
13818: There...
---
13819: This is it.
---
13820: What is this place?
---
13821: Well, which way should we go?
---
13822: Riku! Kairi!
---
13823: It´s no use!
---
13824: Don´t stop moving, or the
darkness will overtake you!
---
13825: Get goin´!
---
13826: Why?
---
13827: Don´t ask. Just do it!
---
13828: You okay?
---
13829: I kidnapped Kairi, but
she got away from me.{:delay C0 00}{:clear }{:delay 3C 00}{:clear }After that, Saïx caught her.
---
13830: Leave us alone!
---
13831: I think I liked it better
when they were on my side.
---
13832: Feeling a little...regret?
---
13833: Nah...I can handle these punks. Watch this!
---
13834: Whoa!
---
13835: You´re...fading away...
---
13836: Well, that´s what happens when you
put your whole being into an attack. {:delay 74 01}{:clear }You know what I mean?{:delay 84 00}{:clear }Not that Nobodies actually
HAVE beings...right?
---
13841: I wanted to see Roxas.
---
13843: This leads to...

13844: Aw, come on! Let´s get going!

Just wondering what was back here.

14379: They're the same.
---
14380: Yeah.
---
14381: Three tickets, please!

14382: I can't help feeling like we won't
see this town again...
---
14383: Why not?
---
14384: You're thinkin' too much.
---
14385: Yeah, you're right!
---
14386: Okay, let's go!
---
14387: Bye!

14388: Hey, Sora. You sure we haven't met before?

14389: Positive.{:delay 32 00}{:clear }{:delay 2D 00}{:clear }Why do you ask?

14391: Oh.
---
14392: Huh?
---
14393: You okay?

14394: Y-yeah.
Don't know where it came from.

14395: Pull it together.
---
14396: Right... See ya.
---
14397: You know...
---
14398: I'm sad.
---
14399: We'll be back.
---
14400: Yeah. We can visit Hayner and
those guys again.
---
14401: Hey you, where'd you come from?
---
14402: Uhh...
---
14403: You here to pick a fight with us

14404: Fight? We're not here to fight.
---
14405: Yeah, you big palooka!
---
14406: Okay, smart alecks...

14407: Time to teach you how to behave
in my town.{:delay 82 00}{:clear }{:delay 0A 00}{:clear }Bring it!
---
14408: Man, what a jerk.
---
14409: 
---
14411: One moment!
---
14412: If you´re gonna fight, why not make it
a proper Struggle?
---
14413: What?
---
14414: You see, Seifer...
I'm a really big fan.
---
14415: Wh-what do you want...
---
14416: In other words, I want to see
more of your "super cool" moves!
---
14417: You handled the tournament with real style,{:delay 9B 00}{:clear }{:delay 14 00}{:clear }and you absolutely dominated the title match.
---
14418: But I just can't get enough.
Don't you see?{:delay C8 00}{:clear }{:delay 0F 00}{:clear }The matches are far too short!
---
14419: And what's your name?
---
14420: Sora.
---
14421: Sora, if you wanna fight a match,
you just say the word.
---
14433: That was undeniable proof that
we totally owned you lamers.
---
14434: So what did you do?{:delay 6C 00}{:clear }Burn it?
---
14435: Ha, not that we need some ----
to prove that you´re losers.
---
14441: He took it!
---
14443: {:delay 4E 00}{:clear }There goes our ride...
---
14444: What´s goin´ on?
---
14445: {:delay 54 00}{:clear }I sent some of my lackeys inside{:delay 82 00}{:clear }to see if the master of this
here tower´s{:delay 82 00}{:clear } as big and tough as they say.
---
14446: Word is, he´s a real powerful sorcerer.{:delay B4 00}{:clear }Which would make him
the perfect bodyguard for me.
---
14447: See, it don´t matter how tough he is--
once he´s a Heartless, he´ll do as I say!
---
14448: A Heartless?
---
14449: That´s right.{:delay 54 00}{:clear }They´re those things that come outta
the darkness in folks´ hearts.{:delay D2 00}{:clear } Why, with all those Heartless at her side,{:delay 96 00}{:clear }my dear friend Maleficent
is gonna conquer everything!
---
14450: And since I got me a debt to pay,{:delay 96 00}{:clear }I´m goin´ ´round to a bunch of
different worlds and{:delay 9C 00} {:clear }buildin´ an army of Heartless,
special for her.
---
14451: Why am I talkin´ to you
pip-squeaks anyway?{:delay 9C 00}{:clear } Go on, scram!
 I´m behind schedule as it is.
---
14452: You oughta find somethin´ nicer to do.
---
14453: Says who?
---
14454: Wha...AAAH! It´s you!
---
14455: Pete!
---
14456: What are you two nimrods doin´ here!?
---
14457: What are YOU doing here?
---
14458: You know him?
---
14459: We sure do!
Pete´s been causin´ trouble for ages!
---
14460: His Majesty banished him to another dimension
a long time ago. I wonder how he escaped.
---
14461: {:delay AE 00}{:clear }You wanna know how, eh?{:delay 78 00}{:clear }Well, Maleficent busted me out,
that´s how!{:delay BA 00}{:clear }{:delay 12 00}{:clear }And now your world--{:delay 66 00}{:clear }no, no, no, all the worlds--
are gonna belong to yours truly.
---
14462: Cause Maleficent´s gonna
help me conquer ´em!
---
14463: Maleficent...huh.
---
14464: What are you laughing at!?{:delay 5A 00}{:clear }{:delay 15 00}{:clear }Why, Maleficent´s power is so great--
---
14465: She´s toast.
---
14467: Whaddaya mean!?
---
14468: You!{:delay 3C 00}{:clear }{:delay 17 00}{:clear } So you´re the ones that did it!
---
14469: Well...{:delay 30 00}{:clear }we mighta had something to do with it.
---
14470: 
---
14471: Heartless Squad!
Round up!
---
14472: You just wait!{:delay 60 00}{:clear }Nobody, and I do mean nobody,
messes with the mighty Pete!
---
14473: So, "mighty" Pete,{:delay 5A 00}{:clear }{:delay 30 00}{:clear }who lives in this tower, anyway?
---
14474: Oh, ya don´t know, eh?{:delay 8A 00}{:clear }Well, it´s old Yen Sid.{:delay 8A 00}{:clear }´Course he´s probably a Heartless by now!
---
14475: Master Yen Sid lives here!?
---
14476: Yen Sid is the King´s teacher!
---
14477: Wow. Sounds powerful!
---
14478: Heartless, Heartless, Heartless!{:delay B4 00}{:clear }{:delay 1E 00}{:clear }Things haven´t changed one bit!
---
14479: Well, it´s a good thing we´re on the job, then.
---
14480: So the worlds aren´t at peace after all?
---
14481: Master Yen Sid! It´s an honor!
---
14482: Hey there!
---
14483: Sora! Show some respect!
---
14484: So, you are Sora.{:delay B4 00}{:clear }{:delay 21 00}{:clear }Now then, have you seen the King yet?
---
14485: Yes, we did, Master. But we didn´t
get a chance to talk to him.
---
14486: Yes...the King has been quite busy of late.
---
14487: Therefore, it would seem that the task of
instructing you three falls upon my shoulders.
---
14488: You have a perilous journey ahead of you.
You must be well prepared.
---
14489: You mean...we have to go on another quest?
---
14490: I was looking forward to finding my friend
Riku, so we could go back to the islands.
---
14491: Yes. I know.{:delay 7E 00}{:clear }However, everything in your
journey, Sora, is connected.
---
14492: Whether you will find your
way home to the islands...
---
14493: Whether you will return alone
or with your friend...
---
14494: And, whether or not the islands
will still be there.
---
14495: And the key that connects
them all is you, Sora.
---
14496: I´m...the key?
---
14497: Chosen wielder of the Keyblade!
---
14498: You are the key that
will open the door to light.
---
14499: This book contains valuable knowledge
you will need for your journey.{:delay F5 00}{:clear }{:delay 35 00}{:clear }Study it carefully.
---
14500: Once you have finished, we will speak
of the enemies you will surely confront.
---
14501: But wait a sec--how come the Heartless
are still running around?
---
14502: Your past endeavors did prevent
an immense effusion of Heartless{:delay 3E 01}{:clear }from the great darkness;{:delay 72 00}{:clear }make no mistake about that.
---
14503: However, the Heartless are
darkness made real--{:delay F6 00}{:clear }{:delay 15 00}{:clear }and darkness yet lingers in every heart.
---
14504: The Heartless are fewer.{:delay 78 00}{:clear }But while darkness exists in a single heart,
it will be difficult to eliminate them.
---
14505: Gawrsh, that must mean...{:delay 7E 00}{:clear }if everybody´s heart was full of light,
them Heartless´d go away!
---
14506: Now it is time to speak of the
enemies that you will encounter.
---
14508: If one such as you, Donald, yields
to the darkness in their heart,{:delay 32 01}{:clear }{:delay 22 00}{:clear }they too will become a Heartless.
---
14509: But you know this.
---
14510: 
---
14511: The Heartless are always lurking and
ever seeking to capture new hearts.{:delay 2C 01}{:clear }Never let your guard down!{:delay 72 00}{:clear }{:delay 3C 00}{:clear }Now then...
---
14512: At times, if someone with
a strong heart and will--{:delay F0 00}{:clear }be they evil or good--
becomes a Heartless,{:delay F6 00}{:clear }{:delay 24 00}{:clear }the empty shell they leave behind
begins to act with a will of its own.

14513: An empty vessel whose heart
has been stolen away...{:delay DE 00}{:clear }{:delay 1B 00}{:clear }A spirit that goes on{:delay 7E 00}{:clear }even as its body fades from existence--
for you see,{:delay EF 00}{:clear }{:delay 18 00}Nobodies do not truly exist at all.
---
14514: Nobodies may seem to have feelings,{:delay A8 00}{:clear }but this is a ruse--
they only pretend to have hearts.
---
14515: You must not be deceived!
---
14516: Nobodies...{:delay 41 00}{:clear }{:delay 32 00}They don´t exist...
---
14517: Now then...the being you see before
you is known as a Dusk.{:delay 80 01}{:clear }{:delay 36 00}{:clear }They are the most common form of Nobody.
---
14518: But there are others--some larger,
some with frightening and unique powers.{:delay 74 01}{:clear }{:delay 36 00}{:clear }Be vigilant!
---
14519: On your journey, you will meet
an alarming number of Dusks.{:delay 2C 01}{:clear }They will all attempt to do you harm.
---
14520: Still, they are nothing but empty shells,
destined to return to darkness.{:delay 2C 01}{:clear }{:delay 12 00}{:clear }But--
---
14521: The beings you see before you now
are different.
---
14522: These powerful Nobodies have formed
a group called Organization {XIII}.{:delay 26 01}{:clear }It commands the lesser Nobodies.
---
14523: Organization {XIII}...
---
14524: While Heartless act on instinct,
Nobodies function in a higher manner.{:delay 2C 01}{:clear }They can think and plan. And it seems
they are working towards a goal.
---
14525: What that goal is, we do not know.
---
14526: The King sensed the danger,
and journeyed forth to fight it.
---
14527: He found the dark realm´s Keyblade,
and with it, closed the door.
---
14528: Now he´s traveling from world to world,
fighting the Heartless{:delay FC 00}{:clear }as he seeks the answer to the riddle
of the Nobodies and Organization {XIII}.
---
14529: Then I guess we better go
find the King first!
---
14530: But where could he be?
---
14531: Well, we won´t know ´til we look.
---
14533: So, before you go, you will need
more suitable traveling clothes.
---
14534: Those look a bit
too small for you.
---
14535: Through there,
you´ll find three good fairies.{:delay BA 00}{:clear }If you ask, they´ll create for you
appropriate garments.
---
14536: Gawrsh, Sora,
you sure are growing fast.
---
14538: Me, you guys, Riku, and the King.{:delay 9C 00}{:clear }{:delay 24 00}{:clear }I don´t care who this Organization is
or what it´s planning.{:delay B4 00}{:clear }{:delay 28 00}{:clear }With the five of us--I mean, six of us--
there´s nothing to worry about. Right?
---
14539: Yeah!
---
14540: Well, look who´s here, dears!
Sora, Donald, and Goofy!
---
14541: Ooh, if you´re looking for clothes,
you´ve come to the right place!
---
14542: I´ll do the designing.
---
14543: Oh, that will never do!
---
14544: Now, now, dears.
---
14545: But don´t you like this better?
---
14546: Hold on!
---
14547: Are you certain?
---
14548: Blue!
---
14549: Aww, would you just decide?
---
14550: All right, then. Together now, dears.
And no more squabbling!
---
14551: Oh, my!
---
14552: Ooh, it´s lovely.
---
14553: Oh, yes! He does look very dashing.
---
14554: Now, those aren´t ordinary garments.
---
14555: They have very special powers.
---
14556: Take the orb, dear.
---
14557: And watch what happens.
---
14558: Whoa!
---
14559: Wow!
---
14560: Two Keyblades!
---
14561: This journey´s gonna be twice
as difficult as your last.
---
14562: Your garments also have other powers--
---
14563: but you will have to discover what they
are as you continue on your journey.
---
14564: Okay, I´ll do my best. And thanks a lot!
---
14565: Oh, and there´s something else
for you from Master Yen Sid.
---
14566: Oh boy!
---
14567: Hey! It´s the Gummi Ship!
---
14568: So you guys ready to go?
---
14569: Now, now, just a moment.
---
14570: Because of your previous endeavors, the
worlds have returned to their original states.
---
14571: That means the pathways between them
have disappeared.
---
14572: How do we get around?
---
14573: Do not fear.{:delay 48 00}{:clear }If what the King suspected proves true,{:delay 90 00}{:clear }{:delay 1D 00}{:clear }the worlds have prepared new pathways
along which you may travel.
---
14574: These pathways may be utilized
by unlocking special gates.
---
14575: How these gates are opened,{:delay 96 00}{:clear }{:delay 0F 00}{:clear }I´m afraid I do not know...
---
14576: However, the Keyblade will
serve as your guide.
---
14577: When a beam of light radiates from the
Keyblade, return to the Gummi Ship.
---
14578: Though the worlds may seem far
apart and out of reach,{:delay DA 00}{:clear }they nonetheless remain connected by
invisible ties. As do our hearts.
---
14579: Our hearts are connected.
---
14580: That is correct.
---
14581: Got it!
---
14582: But be warned.{:delay 8C 00}{:clear }{:delay 2D 00}{:clear } As you proceed...
---
14583: The Heartless and the Nobodies will
be using their own paths:{:delay 0C 01}{:clear }Corridors of darkness, to travel
from world to world.
---
14584: They may be attempting to link these dark
pathways to the gates between the worlds.
---
14585: Hey! That´s not fair!
---
14586: Now then,{:delay 3C 00}{:clear }{:delay 1E 00}{:clear }that is all the information
I can give to you.
---
14587: Go forth, Sora, Donald, and Goofy.{:delay F0 00}{:clear }{:delay 30 00}{:clear } Everyone is waiting.
---
14588: Okay, let´s get going!
---
14589: Master Yen Sid!
---
14590: We sure do appreciate the help.
---
14591: My goodness! What´s that?
---
14592: Haven´t we seen this somewhere before?
---
14593: Yes, dear. I wonder whose it was...
---
14594: Oh! Malefi--
---
14595: No! We mustn´t remember her name!
Oh dear...
---
14596: She was a mean ol´ witch...
---
14597: Oh no! The memories are coming back!{:delay B4 00}{:clear } What´ll we do!? Oooh--what´ll we do!?
---
14598: Perhaps we should tell Master Yen Sid.
---
14599: Yes. That´s what we must do. Hurry!
---
14600: Maleficent!
---
14647: Whatever you think is right, you´re wrong.{:delay C4 00}{:clear } {:delay 1E 00}{:clear }And that is a big mistake.
---
14665: It IS the most suspicious place.
---
14839: Sorry, but Maleficent can´t help ya now.
---
14854: Yeah. And the King must
know where Riku is,{:delay 9C 00}{:clear }{:delay 0F 00}{:clear }´cause the two of them were together in the
realm of darkness when we closed the door.{:delay DE 00}{:clear }{:delay 15 00}{:clear }You know, after defeating Ansem.
---
14855: Uh, I guess...
---
14856: It´s taken me a long time,{:delay 62 00}{:clear } {:delay 32 00}{:clear }but pretty soon Sora will be his old self again.{:delay AE 00}{:clear } {:delay 50 00}{:clear }The process has been
affecting you, too, Roxas.
---
14857: He needs you.
---
14858: I guess I would like to know.{:delay 82 00}{:clear } {:delay 64 00}{:clear } What do you know about me...
---
14859: ...that I don´t?
---
14860: That´s just the curtains moving.{:delay 64 00}{:clear }There must be a draft somewhere.
---
14861: I´m surprised this old place even has curtains.
---
14862: But I don´t know why I have
this power...I just do.{:delay 5E 01}{:clear } {:delay 33 00}{:clear }I´m not even sure there´s a
right way for me to use it.
---
15200: Roxas isn´t the only one who
was never meant to exist.{:delay D2 00}{:clear } {:delay 66 00}{:clear }Take care of it, Ansem.
---
15221: Who will take home the grand prize?
---
15222: The summa cum laude of Struggle--
the Four Crystal Trophy!
---
15274: Roxas! We will meet again.{:delay BF 00}{:clear }And then we can talk about everything.{:delay A2 00}{:clear }I may not know it´s you, and
you may not know it´s me.{:delay 03 01}{:clear }But we will meet again.
---
15275: Someday soon.{:delay 6B 00}{:clear }I promise!
---
15276: It´s just,{:delay 75 00}{:clear } I think--{:delay 64 00}{:clear }I´ve been running away from
the question I really wanna ask:
---
15277: What´s gonna happen to me now?{:delay 78 00}{:clear } {:delay 47 00}{:clear }Just tell me that.{:delay 50 00}{:clear } {:delay 2E 00}{:clear }Nothing else really matters anymore.

---
15383: {:unk13 00 01 52 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}Not bad.

15392: {:unk13 1A 01 82 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}Passable, I´d say.

15398: {:unk13 64 01 A0 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}Well...I guess
that´ll do.

17370: "Town line - free of charge!"
---
17371: The statue is staring at the floor.
---
17372: It´s completely blocked by pipes.
---
17374: This projects the monitor´s image.
---
17375: This looks like someone´s data.
---
17376: You don´t know what this device is.
---
17379: There´s evidence this was used before.
---
17380: This hasn´t been used in a while.
---
17381: This looks like it could still be used.
---
17382: It seems only the power is on.
---
17383: Who built this? And for what purpose?
---
17384: This is the pod Sora was sleeping in.
---
17385: Which will you read?
---
17386: All the mischief the King did years ago
is recorded here.
---
17387: This book describes powerful spells.
---
17388: You see a phantasmic view, as if
overlooking a sea of clouds.
---
17390: Struggle Battle Rule:

"The person who gathers the most
orbs in the time allotted wins!"

17403: This board is used for tournaments.
---
17404: Struggle Battle Rule:

"Attack your opponents and gather
more orbs than they have!"

He with the best strategy wins!"

---
17408: "Synthesis Workshop - coming soon!"
---
17411: You need munny to buy items.{:clear }If you ever need some cash, you
should check the job board here.
---
17412: Watch out, there are bees in there!
Where could they have come from?{:clear }I posted an ad on the job board to
exterminate them, but no one´s replied.
---
17413: I´ve been asked to host the upcoming
Struggle battle!{:clear }I don´t have time to run the shop.
---
17414: I´m stocking up on merchandise now.{:clear }Lots of people will come to see the
Struggle, and I don´t want to run out.
---
17416: Sorry, I´m old so I closed
my shop.{:clear }I´m enjoying life now with my cat,
Chiro.
---
17417: Let´s talk to the lady at the accessory
shop and begin our investigation!
---
17418: The best way to get info is to ask! Talk
to as many people as you can.
---
17419: If you find any interesting looking
places in town, check them out, too!{:clear }You may discover some good info!
---
17420: Look around carefully.
You may find something!{:clear }When investigating, don´t overlook anything!
---
17421: Where could that cat be? It´d be funny
if it was somewhere real close.
---
17422: I don´t think it would go too far. Have
you checked this area carefully?
---
17423: So, you´re feeling up to it?{:clear }Take your time picking a weapon--
not that it´ll matter.
---
17424: Seifer won´t waste his time taking you
guys seriously, y´know!{:clear }He only uses his most powerful attack
when in trouble, y´know!
---
17425: Cakewalk.
---
17429: This place is a mess! Who´s going to
clean all this junk up?
---
17430: {:unk08 00 00 00}This has a hand guard.
It defends well against attacks.
---
17431: {:unk13 00 01 40 01}{:unk08 02 00 06}Prioritize defense?
{:chardelay 33 00}No, I´ll use a different one.
{:chardelay 0A 00}This will do!
---
17432: {:unk08 00 00 00}This looks almost like a staff. You can
perform unusual attacks with this.
---
17433: {:unk13 00 01 40 01}{:unk08 02 00 06}Prioritize unusual attacks?
{:chardelay 33 00}No, I´ll use a different one.
{:chardelay 0B 00}This will do!
---
17434: {:unk08 00 00 00}A club used in Struggle battles.
Its light weight makes it easy to swing.
---
17435: {:unk13 00 01 40 01}{:unk08 02 00 06}Prioritize offense?
{:chardelay 33 00}No, I´ll use a different one.
{:chardelay 09 00}This will do!
---
17439: Just as I thought, I ran out of
merchandise during the Struggle battle!{:clear }You´ll have to wait until I can restock.
---
17440: Chiro!
Where did that cat go?{:clear }It couldn´t have gone too far...
---
17441: Oh, hello, Roxas.
---
17442: If I were you I´d go with the weapon in
the middle. Seifer has to pay!
---
17443: Watch your opponent well. When he
lets his guard down, strike back!{:clear }If you do that, you´ll be sure to win!
---
17444: The weapon on the right´s not bad.{:clear }You can use it in Struggle too,
so it should be easy to fight with!
---
17446: The promoter of this Struggle battle
sure works people hard.{:clear }It´s hard work putting up posters.
Tram Common is huge!
---
17447: Want to help me put on a 
performance?{:clear }I´m hiring some part-time help!
---
17451: Back in the day I used to practice
battling with friends.{:clear }Practicing´s the only way you´ll get
stronger. Seifer might be a good opponent.
---
17453: I found my cat, so I´m going
to move.{:clear }Chiro and I will live out the rest
of our days in the country.
---
17454: Hayner said he´d take care of things,
but I knew something like this would happen.{:clear }You can start work at {:theme 0A}this board{:reset}, or at
the {:theme 0A}Tram Common board{:reset}.
---
17455: Hayner went up this hill. It looks like
he´s waiting at the Station Plaza.{:clear }It seems he´s got some things to do,
so I´m going to try hard, too!
---
17459: You look pretty busy.
You got a job, now?{:clear }I´m going to practice for the next
Struggle battle!
---
17461: Hey, Roxas! Reached your quota yet?
Each of us needs to make 800 munny!{:clear }The ocean´s waiting for us!
I´m counting on you!
---
17462: How´s work going?{:clear }When you´ve earned enough cash,
come back here.
---
17463: Hmm...this should cover expenses...
---
17464: {:unk13 00 01 40 01}{:unk08 02 00 06}Continue working?
{:chardelay 33 00}More munny couldn´t hurt!
{:chardelay 09 00}Nah, I´ve earned enough.
---
17465: Way to go, Roxas!
---
17466: {:unk13 00 01 40 01}{:unk08 02 00 06}Continue working?
{:chardelay 33 00}More munny couldn´t hurt!
{:chardelay 09 00}Nah, I´ve earned enough.
---
17467: Whoa-ho Roxas! You´re the man!
We can even buy a watermelon now!
---
17468: {:unk13 00 01 40 01}{:unk08 02 00 06}That´s plenty of munny. Work more?
{:chardelay 33 00}More munny couldn´t hurt!
{:chardelay 09 00}Nah, I´ve earned enough.
---
17469: This is the first time I´ve been put
in charge of the shop.{:clear }I´m still just learning the ropes, so bear
with me a little longer, okay?
---
17479: It´s hard work delivering letters along
this slope.{:clear }I wish I could find someone
to help me.
---
17489: Have you gone to the top? The sunset
from Sunset Hill is really pretty!
---
17490: I´ve been so busy hosting the Struggle
battle, I forgot all about the shop!{:clear }Sorry, please come back later.
---
17498: Rumors are going around about seven
wonders here in Sunset Terrace.{:clear }I don´t put much stock in rumors, but
this one´s a bit creepy.
---
17499: Have you been to Sunset Hill?
The sunset there is breathtaking!{:clear }Long ago my wife and I would...
...Ah, never mind.
---
17509: I´ve been so busy making weapons for
the Struggle, I forgot all about work!{:clear }Sorry, but my merchandise isn´t ready
yet.
---
17515: I have to move those items into this
garage.{:clear }I posted a help wanted ad, but no one´s
come yet.
---
17516: I´m making weapons for the Struggle
tournament!{:clear }Sorry, but I´m too busy now to run the
shop.
---
17517: Have you been to Sunset Hill yet?
The view is amazing from there.{:clear }I used to walk there through the
tunnelway, but now I take the train.
---
17521: ...{:clear }Listen to the rules.
---
17522: ...{:clear }Don´t hold back.
---
17523: You defeated me, Roxas. You know
what that means, don´t you?{:clear }You better not lose!
---
17524: You´re facing the champion Setzer
next!{:clear }He lets his guard down a lot, so keep
an eye out for your chance to strike!
---
17525: Are you all set?{:clear }The item shop´s open. It might help to
buy something in advance!
---
17526: Hayner loses his cool easily, and
opens himself up to attack.{:clear }Watch for your chance, and you should
win. Just don´t tell him I said anything!
---
17527: Something´s not right with Vivi.{:clear }But if you can avoid his attacks, you
should have an opportunity to hit him.
---
17528: Watching Setzer, I´ve noticed
he has an attack pattern!{:clear }If you can figure it out, it should make
fighting him a lot easier!
---
17529: Seifer and his gang went to the back
alley. They must not like crowds.
---
17530: I hope you´ve bought potions and stuff.
You´ll need ´em when fighting Hayner.{:clear }If you don´t have enough cash, you
can always do some more work!
---
17531: Seifer seems to be taking his loss to
Vivi pretty hard.{:clear }He went to the back alley again.
---
17532: It seems Setzer trained hard
for this tournament.{:clear }You, too, should be prepared when
you face him, Roxas!
---
17533: Struggle battles are nice, but nothing
beats a good street brawl!
---
17534: Hmph!{:clear }You got something to say?
Feel free to step up anytime, kid.
---
17535: You think you´re tough just ´cause
you won?{:clear }Next time I won´t hold back!
---
17536: Seifer´s gonna win,
hands down, y´know!
---
17537: Vivi isn´t that tough, y´know!
This has gotta be a mistake!
---
17538: Seifer wasn´t fighting for real, y´know!
He won´t hold back next time!
---
17539: Victory.
---
17540: Cheater.
---
17541: Lucky.
---
17542: You here for my autograph?
Sorry, but I´m busy.{:clear }Why don´t you go listen to the referee
in front of the board explain the rules?
---
17543: You here to ask the champ to give you
some pointers?{:clear }Just gather the orbs faster than your
opponent. The rest is luck.
---
17544: That was a fun match. But don´t let
down your guard after you get an orb.{:clear }One strategy is to flee so you aren´t
attacked. Nothing works against me, though.
---
17545: Contests are kind of like
flipping a coin.{:clear }Let´s have a go at it, shall we?
Keep it clean, right...?
---
17546: He...hehehehh...{:clear }RR...Ro...
...xaa...ssss...
---
17547: Why did I enter that competition?{:clear }And why is everyone giving me the
cold shoulder?
---
17552: All participants should hear the rules!
---
17553: {:unk13 00 01 40 01}{:unk08 02 00 06}Listen to the rules?
{:chardelay 33 00}Not right now.
{:chardelay 09 00}I´d better listen.
---
17554: Once you´re ready, climb into the ring
and talk to the promoter!
---
17557: First listen to the referee explain
the rules!{:clear }Then I´ll start the tournament. When
it´s your turn, come speak to me.
---
17558: All right, time to begin! I hope you´ve
practiced battling someone!
---
17559: {:unk13 00 01 40 01}{:unk08 02 00 06}Are you ready to take on Hayner?
{:chardelay 33 00}I´m not ready yet.
{:chardelay 09 00}I´m ready! Let´s get started!
---
17560: It´s time for the final match!
Are you ready?
---
17561: {:unk13 00 01 40 01}{:unk08 02 00 06}Are you ready to take on Vivi?
{:chardelay 33 00}I´m not ready yet.
{:chardelay 09 00}I´m ready! Let´s get started!
---
17562: And now for the title match!
Are you all set?
---
17563: {:unk13 00 01 40 01}{:unk08 02 00 06}Are you ready to take on Setzer?
{:chardelay 33 00}I´m not ready yet.
{:chardelay 09 00}I´m ready! Let´s get started!
---
17587: {:color #00F0F080}The main menu can be opened with {:icon dynamic-start}.{:clear }{:reset}View status and munny, and change configuration
settings. The menu cannot be opened during battle.{:clear }Roxas´s Journal contains {:color #00F0F080}hints of what to do next{:reset},
and past events.
---
17588: My dog´s always running off
somewhere.{:clear }Where could he have gone this time?
---
17589: This town is connected by several
tunnelways.{:clear }They scared me when I was a kid, but 
I played in them all the time.
---
17590: I have to put up posters again today for
the next Struggle battle!
---
17593: You were amazing!
Thank you!{:clear }Still, I need more. I can´t wait until the
next Struggle battle!
---
17594: You came from Central Station?{:clear }I´m getting on a train now to go see
my grandchild.
---
17595: I can´t find any rumors about the
seven wonders...{:clear }You guys are getting on a train at the
station, right? I don´t know what I´ll do...
---
17596: There are lots of sketchy places to
check out, like dead ends and tunnels!
---
17597: People leaving balls behind,
Vivi´s voice echoing...{:clear }The "seven wonders" are more like
"seven misunderstandings."
---
17598: Give it up already. The seven
wonders weren´t wonders at all.{:clear }If you´re still not convinced, you can go
to that mansion by yourself.
---
17604: Hayner said he´d find out more and
take care of things.{:clear }He already went running off to the
Station Plaza.
---
17605: How´s it going?{:clear }This place looked suspicious to me, so
I´m checking it out.
---
17606: To think that dog was hiding inside a
bag. How cute!{:clear }Even though it was my own reflection
in the water, I couldn´t help but jump!
---
17607: A mansion beyond a hole in a wall and
the woods...{:clear }That fits the description of a haunted
house, but it´s just a rumor, okay?
---
17609: Struggle battles are nice, but nothing
beats a good street brawl!
---
17610: Seifer could care less about turning in
his homework assignment, y´know!
---
17611: Fool.
---
17612: The only way to grow stronger is
through experience.{:clear }I´m gonna keep getting stronger.
---
17613: I have to practice so I can be strong
like Seifer.{:clear }You can find him in the sandlot, but
don´t expect to beat him.
---
17615: You can now view the status of Party Members
from the main menu.{:clear }All Roxas´s abilities and munny have been
passed on to Sora.{:clear }Jiminy´s Journal contains {:color #00F0F080}hints of what to do next{:reset}

---
17631: Have you come to find a job?{:clear }I can´t find any work
that I can do.
---
17632: My dog may like wandering about,
but he always comes back home!
---
17634: No matter how many I swat,
they just keep coming!{:clear }What am I to do?
---
17635: I hope I can find some performers soon.
I can´t wait!
---
17637: I came here to see the train that
doesn´t have a conductor.{:clear }I´ve been here the entire day, though,
and not one train´s gone by!
---
17638: How am I supposed to carry this stuff
up to the garage?{:clear }And he wants me to hurry? I never
should have taken this job.
---
17639: Walking through the tunnels is better
for your health than taking the train!
---
17641: These Struggle battles always draw
huge crowds, and all because of me!{:clear }No one would know about them
without these posters! Still, I´m beat!
---
17643: This steep slope makes it downright
difficult to deliver letters!{:clear }But the mailman is so fast!
What does he ride on?
---
17645: Rumors are going around about seven
wonders in Sunset Terrace.{:clear }They´re easily explained, but sometimes
things are more than what they appear.
---
17647: I haven´t seen you before. Have you
seen the sunset from Sunset Hill?{:clear }It looks even more beautiful when
going there with someone you love.
---
17648: Sometimes a strange train
stops here.{:clear }I wonder where it goes.
Do you know anything about it?
---
17649: You´re willing to fight!? Great!
First I´d like to test your ability...{:clear }but I don´t have any opponents for you.
You´ll have to wait. Meanwhile, practice!
---
17651: Youngsters walk through the
tunnelways instead of taking the train...{:clear }but I´m too old to do that.
---
17653: I´m getting old. I sure could use
a hand.
---
17654: The station´s just up the slope. Let´s
get on a train and go to Central Station.{:clear }I think the town line´s still free of
charge, so it won´t cost anything!
---
17656: Let´s go solve the mystery of the
Sunset Hill ghost train!{:clear }This one´s got to be real! I can feel it!
Well, at least I think I can...
---
17657: The hole in that Tram Common wall
leads to the haunted mansion.{:clear }But it´s just a rumor. Don´t get your
hopes up.
---
17659: You were asleep for so long, you still
may be kind of dazed, Sora.{:clear }Don´t worry. If you forget what you
have to do, just check Jiminy´s Journal.
---
17660: This is going to be a long journey, so
prepare yourself well!
---
17661: {:unk13 00 01 40 01}{:unk08 02 00 06}Get on the train?
{:chardelay 33 00}Not yet.
{:chardelay 09 00}Get on.
---
17662: Don´t go back to the mansion,
you may fall asleep again!{:clear }Besides, we should check out what
kind of place this is. I´m excited!
---
17663: It´s time for our adventure to begin!{:clear }If there´s something you still want to
do here, now´s your last chance.
---
17664: If you want to know about this town,
go to the sandlot. We´re busy.{:clear }I´m sure Seifer´s bunch will
accommodate you.
---
17665: The guy looking for you is at the station.{:clear }It´s at the top of Station Heights.
You should go see what he wants.
---
17666: We have to do our homework. If you´ve
got time, why don´t you get a job?{:clear }Oh, wait. I don´t think anyone´s hiring
right now.
---
17667: Whether brawling or Struggling, I´m not
gonna lose to the likes of you!{:clear }Why don´t you come back ten years
from now?
---
17668: I don´t know who you are...{:clear }but you don´t stand a chance Struggling
against Seifer, y´know!
---
17669: Instant annihilation.
---
17670: I came because I heard there was
gonna be another Struggle battle.{:clear }The promoter in the sandlot should be
able to tell you more.
---
17671: Seifer´s real strong, y´know!{:clear }Did I sound tough? Did I?
Tough like Rai, y´know!
---
17672: Sorry I was so cold before.
Something´s been bugging me...{:clear }We may not see each other for awhile.
Take care of yourself, okay?
---
17673: That´s weird. I feel like I should see
you off for some reason...{:clear }Like I have to say bye to someone I´ve
been waiting a long time to see...
---
17674: Um, Sora? About that bag of yours...
Uh, never mind.{:clear }Come visit us again, alright?
We´ll be at the usual spot.
---
17675: Well... We got on the train and came
here like the King said.{:clear }Something's strange about this place.
I wonder where we are.
---
17676: Pete´s a little late to the party.{:clear }We already defeated Maleficent.
---
17677: We have to read that book like

need to know what´s been going on!

17678: Someone´s at the entrance of the building.{:clear }Adventuring rule # 17:

---
17679: I never expected to run into
Pete here!{:clear }To think he´s not just messing around

17680: This is a strange tower.
I wonder why it was built...{:clear }Adventuring Rule # 8:

{:chardelay 33 00}Not yet.
{:chardelay 09 00}Please!

17951: You´re not ready for the last outfit.
It won´t work, Sora.{:clear }It can only be worn by one who´s

17952: We´ve been told about you. Hurry up

---
17953: Hmm...
Judging by the look of you, Sora...{:clear }I´d say you might be able to get the
clothes that unleash magic!

17954: These clothes will help you only as
much as your growth allows!{:clear }Their true potential lies dormant. It´s
your job to unleash it!
---
17955: How does your magic outfit feel?
Each outfit has four dormant abilities.{:clear }Specifically, they are...um...oh, what

17970: I bet you can get to the other
Twilight Town through this mansion.

17971: Don´t worry, we´ll stand guard here.
Go check out that mansion!

17972: I can´t believe such an amazing

I don´t understand any of it.

17973: Leave this world to me! If you get in
trouble, just come back.{:clear }That device there should be able to
bring you back.

17974: This mansion´s freaky. It feels like
monsters are lurking in there...

17975: This place is falling apart.{:clear }There´s supposed to be a computer in
this raggedy mansion?

17976: The password´s the name of that ice cream!{:clear }Make sure you get it right. It won´t take
an incorrect password!
---
17977: {:unk13 00 01 31 01}{:unk08 02 00 06}The name of the ice cream was...
{:chardelay 33 00}Sky sugar ice cream

17978: There should be a device like this in

17979: Let´s head in!{:clear }This place has to be hiding some
kind of secret!

17980: I don´t think those white things will
attack us for awhile.{:clear }So you can take your time searching the mansion!

17981: An ice cream flavor? Could it be that
ice cream we used to eat all the time?{:clear }Sweet yet salty...and delicious!
That has to be it!
---
17982: I feel we´ll see you again. Bring Kairi
back with you, okay?{:clear }We´ll be here waiting for you!
---
17983: Riku´s going to be so mad at me.{:clear }Still, we have to hurry and search the
mansion!
---
17984: There should be a computer leading to
another world in this mansion!{:clear }I´m sure we´ll find it if we search hard
enough!
---
17985: That´s it! The ice cream name is
Sea-sa...{:clear }No, you should do this, Sora. Hurry

17986: Ready?{:clear }{:theme 0A}Touch this light{:reset} to be

17987: It may look the same, but this is
different than where we just were.{:clear }The enemy may attack at anytime, so
be careful!

17989: Nothing looks different, but I have a
bad feeling.{:clear }Let´s be ready for anything,

19659: My name is of no importance.{:delay DC 00}{:clear }What about you?{:delay 9C 00}{:clear }Do you remember your true name?
---
19660: My true name...is...
---
19661: 
---
19662: Gimme a break, Kai--!
---
19663: Giving up already?
---
19664: If there are any other worlds out there,
why did we end up on this one?
---
19665: This world has been connected.
---
19666: Wh-who´s there?
---
19667: Tied to the darkness...
---
19668: Sora, don´t ever change.
---
19669: The door has opened...
---
19670: What?
---
19671: You understand nothing.
---
19672: Sora...
---
19673: {:delay 1E 00}{:clear }Where am I?
---
19674: What happened to my home?
My island?
---
19675: Riku! Kai--!
---
19676: Who are you?
---
19677: They will come at you out of nowhere,
as long as you continue to wield the Keyblade.
---
19678: Hey, why don´t you come with us?
We can go to other worlds on our vessel.
---
19679: Sora, go with them.
Especially if you want to find your friends.
---
19680: Donald Duck.
---
19681: Name´s Goofy.
---
19682: I´m Sora.
---
19683: I´ll go with you, guys.
---
19684: The Heartless have great fear of the Keyblade.
---
19685: That's right. The Keyblade.
---
19686: So...this is the key.
---
19687: As the key bearer,
you must already know{:delay F0 00}{:clear }one must not meddle in
the affairs of other worlds.
---
19688: So many places I want to see...
I know I´ll get there someday.
---
19689: Thus, I do hereby dub thee junior heroes--
---
19690: Hey! What do you mean "junior heroes"?
---
19691: You rookies still don´t understand
what it takes to be a true hero.
---
19692: I...I wish...
...for your freedom, Genie.
---
19693: Al!
---
19694: Sally, why didn´t I listen to you?
---
19695: Don´t feel bad, Jack.{:delay 58 00}{:clear }We´ll come up with another
plan for Halloween.{:delay AC 00}{:clear }Next time, we´ll do it together.
---
19696: Power!
---
19697: I am Mushu.
---
19698: Or are you too cool to play them
now that you have the Keyblade?
---
19699: Riku! What are you doing here?
---
19700: Did you find her?
---
19701: I still can´t believe it.{:delay A2 00}{:clear }I really flew. Wait ´til I tell Kai--.{:delay C6 00}{:clear }I wonder if she´ll believe me. Probably not.
---
19702: I´m searching, too.
---
19703: For your light?
Don´t lose sight of it.
---
19704: Sora, where are you going?
---
19705: I´m gonna go look for my friends.
They´re waiting for me.
---
19706: Where are Donald and Goofy?
---
19707: Instead of worrying about them,
you should be asking about her.
---
19708: It´s up to me.{:delay 78 00}{:clear }Only the Keyblade master can open
the secret door and change the world.
---
19709: But I´m not gonna betray Sora, either.
---
19710: All for one and one for all.
---
19711: My friends are my power!
---
19712: So, your heart won this battle.
---
19713: It is I, Ansem,
---
19714: lead me into everlasting darkness!
---
19715: Sora!
---
19716: Forget it!
There´s no way you´re taking Kairi´s heart!
---
19717: Kairi.
---
19718: We may never meet again,
but we´ll never forget each other.
---
19719: No matter where we are,
our hearts will bring us together again.
---
19720: Take this.{:delay 4B 00}{:clear }It´s my lucky charm.
Be sure to bring it back to me.
---
19721: Don´t worry. I will.
---
19722: Promise?
---
19723: Gawrsh, is that all that´s left of
the worlds taken by the Heartless?
---
19724: Those worlds will be restored
if we beat Ansem, right?{:delay A8 00}{:clear }But, if we do beat him and all these worlds
become restored and disconnected,{:delay 55 01}{:clear }what´s gonna happen to this place? And to us?
---
19725: All worlds begin in darkness,{:delay AE 00}{:clear }and all so end.{:delay 84 00}{:clear }The heart is no different. {:delay 9F 00}{:clear }You see, darkness is
the heart´s true essence.
---
19726: That´s not true!{:delay 34 00}{:clear }The heart may be weak.
And sometimes it may even give in.{:delay 2C 01}{:clear }But I´ve learned that deep down,
there´s a light that never goes out!
---
19727: Kingdom Hearts!{:delay 8C 00}{:clear }Fill me with the power of darkness!
---
19728: You´re wrong.{:delay 5E 00}{:clear }I know now,{:delay 4C 00}{:clear }without a doubt.{:delay 6B 00}{:clear }Kingdom Hearts is light!
---
19729: Now, Sora!
Let´s close this door for good!
---
19730: Take care of her.
---
19731: Kairi!
---
19732: Sora!
---
19733: Kairi, remember what you said before?{:delay 96 00}{:clear }I´m always with you, too.{:delay 67 00}{:clear }I´ll come back to you.{:delay 63 00}{:clear }I promise!
---
19734: I know you will!
---
19735: Well, now what do we do?
---
19736: We´ve gotta find Riku and King Mickey.
---
19737: But, uh, where do we start lookin´
for that there door to the light?
---
19738: Pluto?
---
19739: Gawrsh, that´s the king´s seal!{:delay 96 00}{:clear }Hey, have you seen King Mickey?
---
19740: Let´s go!
---
19741: But the boy is a problem.
He found one of the Keyholes.
---
19744: Don´t ever forget.{:delay 54 00}{:clear }Wherever you go, I´m always with you.
---
19747: 
---
19863: 
---
19890: You seek answers.
---
19891: You feel nothing.{:delay B0 00}{:clear } {:delay 55 00}{:clear }Nothing is real.
---
19892: I can give you purpose.
---
19893: Roxas.
---
19894: That is right--the new you.
---
19895: Guess that's that.
---
19896: Let's go.
---
19897: Go where?{:delay 6E 00}{:clear } {:delay 0A 00}{:clear }It's not like we have homes to return to.
---
19898: We don't exist, remember?
---
19899: Yes, it's true. We may not have homes...
---
19900: But there IS someplace I want to go.{:delay A5 00}{:clear }And...someone I want to see.
---
19901: Same here.
---
19902: So, you think you might let us go?{:delay 96 00}{:clear }I know you're here to get rid of us, but...
---
19903: DiZ? Wants to get rid of me?
---
19904: Go.
---
19905: You sure about this?
---
19906: I owe you both.
---
19907: For what?
---
19908: Castle Oblivion. You helped us.
---
19909: Heh. You don't have to tell me twice.
---
19910: Thank you.
---
19911: Look who's finally awake.
---
19912: Axel...
---
19913: Or, maybe I have it wrong.{:delay A5 00}{:clear } {:delay 23 00}{:clear }Might be time to sleep.{:delay 82 00}{:clear }Soon, we won't be able to
talk like this anymore.
---
19914: Does that mean...{:delay 7D 00}{:clear }it's time for me to go back
to where I belong?
---
19915: You know, I've been thinking about
something Naminé said.{:delay 0E 01}{:clear } {:delay 32 00}{:clear }Roxas, are you really sure that
you don't have a heart?{:delay 68 01}{:clear }Is it possible that we ALL have one?
You, me, her...{:delay 40 01}{:clear }Or is that just wishful thinking?
---
19916: I dunno.{:delay A9 00}{:clear }I can't...just look inside.
---
19919: C'mon, don't leave me hanging.
---
19920: Sora will find the answer we're
looking for. I know he will.{:delay 1D 01}{:clear }Because he's me.
---
19921: True enough.
---
19922: Man, I miss the old times.
Still got it memorized?{:delay E3 00}{:clear }The day we met, when you got your
new name, you and I sat right here{:delay 2B 01}{:clear }and watched the sun set.
---
19923: Yeah. This place is home.{:delay C8 00}{:clear } {:delay 64 00}{:clear }Me, Hayner, Pence, Olette...{:delay 39 01}{:clear }We've shared a lot of adventures.
---
19924: You'll see them again. I know you will.
---
19925: Yeah, you're right.{:delay B4 00}{:clear } {:delay 1E 00}{:clear }Well, I should go. Sora's waiting for me.
---
19926: Yeah, I suppose he is.{:delay 81 00}{:clear } {:delay 83 00}{:clear }Man, this is some good ice cream, huh?
---
19927: Take care, okay?
---
19928: Right back at ya, buddy.
---
19987: Yeah, I guess not.
---
20172: {:unk08 02 00 06}It's an Absent Silhouette, a shadowy presence
within an emblem.
{:chardelay 33 00}Who cares?
{:chardelay A1 00}Let's check it out!
---
20188: But I figure, if there is something
in there--inside us--{:delay 13 01}{:clear } {:delay 0F 00}{:clear }
then we'd feel it, wouldn't we?
---
20189: And if so...{:delay 82 00}{:clear } {:delay 19 00}{:clear }No, never mind.
---
20539: An image of you obtaining old powers
flows into your mind.
---
20540: You have obtained a puzzle piece!
Puzzle pieces are scattered all over the world.{:clear }Some can only be accessed after learning
a certain ability. You can view collected
pieces in Jiminy's Journal.
---
20594: Press {:icon dynamic-triangle} to begin the duel! Defeat the enemies that appear before you!
---
20596: Press {:icon dynamic-triangle} to begin the duel! Once you pull it out, don't let it touch the ground!
---
20598: Press {:icon dynamic-triangle} to begin the duel! Defeat the enemy while avoiding its attacks!
---
20687: Defeat Axel from Organization {XIII}!
Make sure to avoid the flames!
---
21374: {:delayandfade 07 B4} 
In order to plan for the beach, Hayner
suggested we do odd jobs around town for
munny. After all, what's a trip to the beach
without some watermelon and pretzels?
 
After a day of hard work...
 
 
 
 

---
21379: {:unk13 2C 01 3C 00}{:unk08 01 01 06}Huh? Sora, I think
you dropped something.
---
21380: {:unk13 4A 01 64 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}Huh?
---
21381: {:unk13 72 01 BE 00}{:unk08 01 00 00}It must have fallen out
of your pocket.
---
21382: {:unk13 9B 00 3C 00}{:unk08 01 00 04}What is it?
Part of a picture?
---
21383: {:unk13 AA 00 96 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}Is this a gift, too?
---
21384: {:unk13 04 01 E6 00}{:unk08 01 00 01}Oh? We don't know
anything about that.
---
21385: {:unk13 40 01 E6 00}{:unk08 01 00 02}But if you found it in your pocket,
it must have something to do
with your adventure.
---
21386: {:unk13 59 01 18 01}{:unk08 01 01 02}Hold onto it, dear.{:clear }In fact, you should hold onto
any other pieces you come
across on your journey.
---
21387: {:unk13 C8 00 46 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}I'll make sure to note them
in my journal!
---
21473: {:delayandfade 07 B4} 
Two figures appear in the Dark Margin. One claims to be nothing
but an empty shell. He asks the other, "Do you remember
your true name?"
 
Before he can respond, the dream ends, only to be replaced
by another.
 
 
 
 

---
21474: {:delayandfade 07 B4} 
The beach was the playground of a young boy named Sora.
On the sandy shores, he and his friends would laugh and play
until the sun disappeared from the sky.
 
But one day, the door to another realm appeared,
sucking into the darkness his home, the island,
and everything he knew.
 
...Including his best friend.
 

---
21475: {:delayandfade 07 B4} 
He finds himself in an unfamiliar town. There, he meets
his new pals, Donald and Goofy. The three set off together in
search of their missing friends.
 
Unbeknownst to the boy, the weapon he wields, the Keyblade,
is the key to unlocking everything.
 
 
 
 

---
21476: {:delayandfade 07 B4} 
As the boy travels to different worlds and makes new friends,
his heart grows stronger.
 
But it's not yet enough to reunite him with the one he
yearns to see.
 
 
 
 
 

---
21477: {:delayandfade 07 B4} 
When Roxas arrives at the gang's usual
spot, he spots a note from Hayner.
 
"Meet at the station. Today's the day we
hit the beach!"
 
He heads for the station, excited at the
prospect of a fun day with his friends.
 
 

---
21478: {:delayandfade 07 B4} 
The hero who wields the Keyblade has the power to unlock
the secret door and change the world.
 
However, his path is filled with relentless battles.
Now, a foe clad in black stands in his way. By his side is Ansem,
seeker of darkness.
 
 
 
 

---
21479: {:delayandfade 07 B4} 
The gang decides to investigate the
mysterious rumors floating around
town--the seven wonders of Twilight
Town--for their independent studies
homework.
 
Hayner and Olette head into town for
new information while Roxas and Pence
hop on the train in hopes of uncovering
the truth behind the rumors.

---
21480: {:delayandfade 07 B4} 
Roxas and his friends investigate the
rumors one by one, but their findings all
prove to be disappointing. A dog? Their
own reflection?
 
The truths behind the wonders are
anything but wonderful.
 
 
 

---
21481: {:delayandfade 07 B4} 
Ansem claims that at the core of every heart is darkness.
However, beyond that exists light--that which can banish any
and all darkness.
 
And within Kingdom Hearts lies that very light.
 
 
 
 
 

---
21482: {:delayandfade 07 B4} 
According to the King, the computer in
the mansion is connected with the other
Twilight Town. From there, one should
be able to enter the realm of darkness.
 
Hoping to find his friends, he searches
every inch of the mansion.
 
 
 

---
21629: {:delayandfade 07 B4} 
After rescuing Kairi's heart, Sora faces one last battle.
 
He finds strength in the promises they made to
each other long ago.
 
"No matter where we are, our hearts will bring us
together again."
 
"Don't forget. Wherever you go, I'm always with you."
 

---
21630: {:delayandfade 07 B4} 
Sora says good-bye to his friend in hopes of reuniting with
her again. But he's not alone; they're together in spirit,
after all.
 
Only when they all return to their hometown will their journey end.
 
And so, the story continues...
 
 
 

---
21696: Thanks.
