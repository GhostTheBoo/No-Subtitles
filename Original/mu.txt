4105: What is it? Giving up on the mission?
---
4106: {:unk13 00 01 40 01}{:unk08 02 00 06}Should I reject it?
{:chardelay 33 00}No sir!
{:chardelay 0A 00}I need more rest.
---
4107: Your mission is to secure the path over
the summit so our company can pass.{:clear }I´ve authorized you to be let through
to the summit. Don´t let me down!
---
4108: On the way to the mountain, you´ll come to a
checkpoint. Beyond that is the mountain trail.{:clear }The whole place is swarming with
enemies. For what it´s worth, be careful.
---
4109: A whirlwind came and blew me to
the top of the turret.{:clear }If it did that to me, imagine what
it could do to the others.
---
4110: There are explosives inside
the tent, so be careful.{:clear }If you mess around too much next to
the tent...KA-BOOM!!! Got the picture?
---
4111: All´s quiet here. You´d better take
your mission seriously.{:clear }If you don´t do it quickly, Captain
Shang´s going to have your hide.
---
4113: We don´t know where the enemy
is, or what traps they´ve set.{:clear }Be prepared for anything.
---
4114: You can reach the summit by
climbing up here.{:clear }I don´t see why anyone would want to
go there, though, unless they had to.
---
4115: It´s so quiet around here
that it makes me hungry...
---
4116: See that cave back there?{:clear }It looks pretty creepy, kinda like
something might jump right out!
---
4117: The entire country´s terrified
of Shan-Yu´s brutality.{:clear }I know I have my orders, but why
do I have to be put in danger?
---
4119: I´ll be okay. It´s just a
flesh wound.{:clear }Don´t let the enemy get away. They´re headed
for the summit. Be careful--they´re strong!
---
4120: Look at what they did to this village.
How could anyone be so brutal...?{:clear }We can´t let them get away with this.
Let´s show them what we´re made of!
---
4121: Shan-Yu attacked the village with some
creatures I´ve never seen before.{:clear }A falcon even captured some of us...
---
4122: I saw Shan-Yu with my own eyes! A falcon
was on his shoulder, and he was laughing.{:clear }He had a beast-like glow in his eyes
that made my hair stand on end!
---
4123: Shan-Yu has a falcon that´s
rumored to look ferocious.{:clear }Did you see that burnt village?
Imagine what he´ll do to us!
---
4125: Each time I see this village, I
remember that invasion like it was yesterday.{:clear }I´m just glad we could save our country.
Not bad, for a bunch of ragtag soldiers!
---
4126: I had no idea Ping, er,
Mulan was a girl.{:clear }I don´t know which surprised me
more--that, or that she beat Shan-Yu!
---
4127: Our company was thrown together to
help defend against Shan-Yu´s invasion.{:clear }We never would have accomplished so
much if it wasn´t for the Captain.
---
4130: What was that huge shadow?
It seemed to be heading toward the {:theme 0A}palace{:reset}.{:clear }To get there, follow the path out
of the checkpoint as it curves right.
---
4131: Be careful, anything can
happen in battle.{:clear }Be aware of your surroundings, and
use anything that can give you an advantage.
---
4132: Hmm... To combat a flying opponent,
one must fly himself.{:clear }Birds know that height means dominancy.
Fly high, and maybe you´ll spot a weakness.
---
4133: Thank you for saving
the Emperor.
---
4134: We will guard the Emperor
with our lives.{:clear }Rest assured on your journey.
---
4135: We´re actually supposed to be patrolling
the {:theme 0A}mountain{:reset}, but it´s so cold and windy!{:clear }Well, we CAN see the mountain
from here.
---
4136: Oh no! A giant monster is flying
toward the capital!{:clear }Sure, I was sleeping on duty,
but this wasn´t a dream! No, really!
---
4137: The Captain´s gone, so we´re
running whenever the enemy comes.{:clear }They don´t chase us too far.
Better to live and fight another day, right?
---
4138: Did you hear? A flying monster has been
spotted. I think he just dreamt it up, though.{:clear }The palace? Just go down to
the checkpoint. The gate´s downriver.
---
4166: Attack!
---
4167: 
---
4168: Stand back!
---
4169: We'll handle this!
---
4170: Sorry!{:delay 3C 00}
---
4171: Yes!{:delay 3C 00}
---
4172: Captain?
---
4173: Look out!{:delay 2D 00}
---
4174: {:delay 2D 00}Thanks, Ping.{:delay 2D 00}
---
4175: It...was nothing.
---
4176: I should never have doubted you.{:delay 5A 00}{:clear }{:delay 1E 00}From now on, you have my trust.
---
4178: Thank you, Captain.
---
4180: {:delay 2F 00}{:clear }First she uses me as
a lighter,{:delay 5A 00}{:clear }then she turns me into
a cannon ball.{:delay 6C 00}{:clear }The head ancestor´s gonna
hear about this.
---
4181: You know, that´s it!
I give up!{:delay 3C 00}{:clear }{:delay 14 00}I can´t take this no more.{:delay 46 00}{:clear }{:delay 14 00}C´mon, Mulan.{:delay 1E 00}{:clear }Let´s quit this charade and
go home, girl.
---
4183: Mushu!
---
4184: 
---
4185: Mulan?{:delay 28 00}{:clear }A woman?{:delay 3C 00}{:clear }{:delay 28 00}It can´t be!
---
4186: Ping! Captain!
---
4187: Oh boy, you´re okay!
---
4188: You all knew, didn´t you?{:delay 73 00}{:clear }You knew Ping was really a
woman in disguise.
---
4191: I can´t believe you lied to me.
---
4192: {:delay 14 00}The punishment for high treason
and dishonoring the Army...{:delay 8C 00}{:clear }{:delay 3C 00}is death.{:delay 1E 00}
---
4193: Get out of my sight...now.{:delay 78 00}{:clear }{:delay 3C 00}{:clear }You´re all dismissed.
---
4195: But Captain...
---
4196: My debt is repaid.
---
4197: The Emperor is waiting!{:delay 4B 00}{:clear }{:delay 28 00}{:clear }Move out!
---
4198: Mulan... I blew it.
---
4199: Thank you, everyone.{:delay 55 00}{:clear }{:delay 23 00}{:clear }Sorry I got you in trouble.
---
4201: It´s no big deal.
---
4202: So Ping...{:delay 28 00}{:clear }{:delay 28 00}{:clear }I mean, uh, Mulan...what´re
you gonna do now?
---
4203: Go back home.
---
4204: Your daddy´s gonna be steamed
as a chicken dumpling.{:delay 1E 00}
---
4205: Relax, we´ll take our share
of the blame.
---
4206: Thanks.{:delay 1E 00}{:clear }You´re all wonderful friends.
---
4207: 
---
4208: 
---
4209: {:delay 1E 00}You´re going the wrong way!
---
4210: 
---
4211: Mulan!
---
4212: Way to go!
---
4213: See that, Mulan? It´s Shan-Yu,
leader of the Hun army!
---
4214: C´mon, girl. This is your big chance!
---
4215: I can see it now: "Fa Mulan
whups public enemy number one!"{:delay 96 00}{:clear }You gonna be famous! I´m talkin´ A-list!
---
4216: Mushu, I´m not sure...
---
4217: I haven´t even joined the army yet.{:delay 64 00}{:clear }I have to take my father´s place
to preserve the Fa family honor.
---
4218: I just hope I don´t get discovered.
---
4219: Whatever. You just scared--admit it.
---
4220: Aren´t you?
---
4221: 
---
4222: 
---
4223: A Heartless?
---
4224: Let´s get the jump on ´im!
---
4225: Gawrsh, maybe we better
look before we leap.
---
4226: Is that Mushu?
---
4227: That´s right, I know you heard of me!{:delay 6C 00}{:clear }I´m little, lethal, and legendary!
---
4228: Now y´all scram before I
get my dragon dander up!
---
4229: Hey, Mushu! We missed you!
---
4230: Well you better HOPE I miss
YOU, or else you´re--{:delay 9C 00}{:clear }you´re...
---
4231: ...Sora! Donald! Goofy!
---
4232: Do you know them?
---
4233: KNOW them!?{:delay 32 00}{:clear }Man, we used to kick all kinds
of bad guy butt together!
---
4234: Yeah, you know, I helped these guys
out of a lot of tight spots.{:delay 84 00}{:clear }´Cause I´m a mighty dragon! Right?
---
4235: Something like that.{:delay 6E 00}{:clear }And...you are?
---
4236: I´m Mulan.{:delay 5C 00}{:clear }Um, no, I-I mean...
---
4237: Ping!
---
4238: Mulan Ping?
---
4239: Just...Ping.
I am Ping, son of Fa Zhou.
---
4240: You know Mushu?
---
4241: Mushu´s one of my family´s guardians.
---
4242: We didn´t know we were borrowin´ somebody
as important as a family guardian.
---
4243: Yeah, that´s right!
---
4244: And that puts you three up to your
eyeballs in debt to Ping here.{:delay D2 00}{:clear }Well, guess what, kiddies?
It´s payback time!
---
4245: Mushu...
---
4246: Ah, they don´t mind. Ain´t that right?
---
4247: Hmm, sounds fair.
---
4248: See, Ping here was just on his
way to join the Imperial army.
---
4249: We gotta go find the other
recruits over at the training camp.
---
4250: Would you join us?{:delay 5E 00}{:clear }It´ll be easier to fit in
if I´m with guys, like you.
---
4251: What do you mean, "fit in"?
---
4252: Well, um, uh, don´t--
don´t worry about that.
---
4253: You´re pretendin´ to be a boy, aren´t ya?
---
4254: You´re a...girl?
---
4255: You didn´t notice?
---
4256: Not me.
---
4257: I think it´s working.
---
4258: I don´t know--those two
would fall for anything.
---
4259: I´m right here!
---
4260: Remember, girl--man-ly!
---
4261: ´Bout time we got some grub.
---
4262: Hey, no cutting!
---
4263: Get out!
---
4264: 
---
4265: Back off!
---
4266: Hey, a space in line!
---
4267: I wonder what they´re
serving for lunch today.
---
4268: Knuckle sandwiches!
---
4269: That does it!
---
4270: Please!
---
4271: Please!?
---
4272: What a girl!
---
4273: Uh...knock it off!
---
4274: Knock what off?
---
4275: Cutting in line!
---
4276: You punched me!
---
4277: What a shrimp!
---
4278: Who you callin´ a shrimp, panda lips?
I´m a bona fide guardian dragon!
---
4279: L-let´s just get back in line, okay?
---
4280: Whose side are you on?
I just got slugged!
---
4281: Want some more?
---
4282: Soldiers! Get back in line!
---
4283: The Captain!
---
4285: What are they?
---
4286: Heartless!
---
4288: Oh yeah?
---
4289: Ping, I hope you´re ready!
---
4290: {:unk13 34 01 35 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}You three. What are your names?

4291: {:unk13 52 01 67 00}{:unk08 01 00 06}Sora.

are encouraging.

4295: {:unk13 F0 00 E6 00}{:unk08 01 00 01}I am the son of Fa Zhou--
---
4296: {:unk13 5E 01 3C 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}You should
return home.
---
4297: {:unk13 09 01 FA 00}{:unk08 01 00 00}B-but...{:clear }That would dishonor
my family!
---
4298: {:unk13 68 01 3C 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}You´d rather
dishonor my troops?
---
4299: {:unk13 78 00 FA 00}{:unk08 01 01 01}Don´t make me--!
---
4300: {:unk13 0B 01 4C 00}{:unk08 01 00 06}If Ping trains hard
and does his best,{:clear }he´ll get stronger
in no time.
---
4301: {:unk13 D2 00 3C 00}{:unk08 01 00 06}Hmm...
---
4302: {:unk13 BE 00 69 00}{:unk08 01 00 06}Just give us an assignment!{:clear }We´ll show you how well
we can work together.
---
4303: {:unk13 31 01 2D 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}So...you want to be tested?
---
4304: {:unk13 3F 01 32 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}Our orders are to
ambush Shan-Yu´s army{:clear }on their way here.{:clear }They should be coming
through the mountain pass.
---
4305: {:unk13 01 01 6E 00}{:unk06 02}{:unk08 03 01 06}We´ll smash them!
---
4306: {:unk13 22 01 46 00}{:unk08 01 00 04}I doubt that.
You four will be
the advance party.{:clear }Scout out the mountain
for my troops.
---
4307: {:unk13 D7 00 69 00}{:unk08 01 00 06}That´s it? No problem.
---
4308: {:unk13 F0 00 64 00}{:unk08 01 00 06}Right?
---
4309: {:unk13 01 01 5A 00}{:unk08 01 01 06}R-right.
---
4310: {:unk13 58 01 3F 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}I´ll brief you on
the details later.{:clear }Return when you´re
ready to depart.{:clear }Remember, the smallest
mission may have the
greatest purpose.{:clear }Stay alert!

4317: {:unk13 C8 00 E6 00}{:unk08 01 00 00}Captain...

4318: {:unk13 4A 01 32 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}I suppose you´ve made a

4319: {:unk13 E1 00 BE 00}{:unk08 01 01 04}Not a little--
a lot!

4320: {:unk13 0E 01 36 01}{:unk08 01 01 02}No. You´re right, Captain.{:clear }Please give me one

4328: {:unk13 96 00 32 00}{:unk08 01 01 06}A man among men!

4330: {:unk13 60 00 74 00}{:unk08 01 01 06}Captain!
---
4331: {:unk13 40 01 3C 00}{:unk08 01 01 06}Ping sure did great!

4332: {:unk13 C8 00 78 00}{:unk08 01 01 05}You bet he did!

4333: {:unk13 09 01 54 01}{:unk08 01 00 01}Hmm... Fine. I´ll let
you join my troops...{:clear }But I´m still not convinced
you have what it takes{:clear }to be a worthy soldier.
---
4334: {:unk06 02}{:unk13 FA 00 46 00}{:unk08 03 01 06}Why not!?
---
4335: {:unk13 01 01 3C 00}{:unk08 01 01 06}It´s all right, Sora.{:clear }I´ll find a way to show
him what I´m made of.{:clear }Just give me a chance.

4336: {:unk13 09 01 54 01}{:unk08 01 00 01}That´s the spirit, Ping.

4339: {:unk13 DC 00 50 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}Thanks!

4341: {:unk13 C8 00 D1 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}Okay, girl! Here´s your chance!{:clear }I just saw this real shady guy.{:clear }And I know it´s Shan-Yu.

4342: {:unk13 78 00 50 00}{:unk06 02}{:unk08 03 01 06}Shan-Yu!?
---
4343: {:unk13 36 01 41 00}{:unk08 01 01 06}That´s the Hun leader!{:clear }We´ve got to tell the Captain!
---
4344: {:unk13 78 00 3C 00}{:unk08 01 01 06}Right!
---
4345: {:unk13 00 01 CA 00}{:unk06 02}{:unk08 03 00 06}Waaait wait-wait-wait WAIT!{:clear }Everybody use their heads a sec.
---
4346: {:unk13 07 01 B5 00}{:unk08 01 00 06}Now, why are we here?{:clear }To make the Captain
see Mulan´s--I mean,
Ping´s talents{:clear }and bring honor to her family.
---
4347: {:unk13 C8 00 D2 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}So, let´s go find out where
Shan-Yu is, by ourselves.{:clear }Then, if we´re lucky, we can
fry him up good!{:clear }Though just tracking the guy
down should earn us our stars...{:clear }Captain Musclehead will
have to notice my girl!
---
4348: {:unk13 0F 01 2F 00}{:unk08 01 00 06}Okay. Let´s go.
---
4349: {:unk13 14 01 31 00}{:unk08 01 01 06}We´ll help out.
---
4350: {:unk13 96 00 D1 00}{:unk06 02}{:unk08 03 00 06}Now we´re cookin´!
---
4351: {:unk13 AA 00 6E 00}{:unk08 01 01 05}Shan-Yu is in a cave
outside the village!
---
4352: {:unk13 2C 01 78 00}Dead end.
---
4353: {:unk13 22 01 DC 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}There´s nobody here...

4354: {:unk13 C8 00 5A 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}You´re crazy. Check again!

4355: {:unk13 22 01 DC 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}Oh, well...

4356: {:unk13 9A 00 92 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}Wait for me, Donald!

4357: {:unk13 4A 01 8C 00}{:unk08 01 00 06}Hey, wait up!
---
4358: {:unk13 19 01 7D 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}Huh?

4370: Don´t overdo it, Captain!

4377: You mean MY fault.

4378: Uh-uh!

4379: Shan-Yu and the Heartless
did this, not us!

4380: Captain, if you track down the

---
4381: Let´s go.

4392: That´s an order!

4393: Captain!{:delay 47 00}{:clear }We´ll secure the courtyard,

4395: That´s an order!

4402: I´ve heard a great deal about you, Fa Mulan.
---
4403: 
---
4404: You stole your father´s armor, ran away
from home, impersonated an Imperial soldier.
---
4405: You deceived your commanding officer,
shamed the entire Chinese army,{:delay 54 01}{:clear }and dishonored your family name.
---
4406: We get the picture...

4407: You´re a young woman. And in the end...

4410: Your Excellency!

4415: Sora. Donald. Goofy.
---
4416: Thank you.
---
4417: "Thank you"?
Is that all there is to say, Captain?
---
4418: If you wish to win the heart of
Fa Mulan, China´s bravest woman,{:delay F5 00} {:delay 37 00}{:clear }you´ll have to be a bit
more eloquent than that!
---
4419: 
---
4420: Can I get an autograph?
---
4421: Thanks for everything, Sora.
---
4422: Now they GOTTA let me go back to

---
4423: But Mushu, I thought you already
WERE a family guardian!
---
4424: What? Oh, no, no--don´t even worry about that,
that´s just real technical. Just for us guardians.
---
4425: You tricked us!

4426:

4427: Huh?
---
4428: Okay!

4429: Guess it´s about time to be movin´ on.

4432: Of course!

4448: What is that?
---
4449: The guy in black.
---
4450: One of the bad guys!
---
4451: I knew it!
---
4452: There´s a rumor in the Imperial City about
a spy in black, lurking in the mountains.
---
4453: I´d been up here tracking him,
but when you arrived, I lost him.
---
4455:

4456: Sorry!

4457: Don´t apologize. But I

4471: What!? You lost him?

4472: Anyway... What now?

4474: What was that?{:delay 64 00}{:clear } {:delay 46 00}{:clear }Come on, we better get off the mountain.

4480: {:unk13 5A 00 B4 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}Well, now...

4481: {:unk13 9E 00 F3 00}{:unk06 01}{:unk08 01 01 05}What? Is that a problem?

4492: No. Never heard of him.
---
4493: {:unk13 82 00 3C 00}{:unk08 01 01 05}Guess it wasn´t Riku.
---
4494: {:unk13 64 00 64 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}Sorry, Sora.

4495: {:unk13 4A 01 64 00}{:unk08 01 00 06}Oh! Right!

4498: {:unk13 B4 00 5A 00}{:unk06 01}{:unk08 01 01 06}Ahh. So it is as the

4499: {:unk13 A7 00 74 00}{:unk08 01 00 06}Y-yes, Your Excellency.
---
4500: {:unk13 E6 00 5A 00}{:unk06 01}{:unk08 01 01 06}You see, a young stranger
visited us not long ago.
---
4501: {:unk13 01 01 55 00}{:unk06 01}{:unk08 01 01 06}The Captain fought the visitor,
but was quickly defeated.
---
4502: {:unk13 C8 00 64 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}To my dishonor.
---
4503: {:unk13 F0 00 64 00}{:unk06 01}{:unk08 01 01 06}It seems that young man was the one in
black that I have heard whispers about.
---
4504: {:unk13 DC 00 96 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}Did he mention the name Riku?
---
4505: {:unk13 96 00 64 00}{:unk06 01}{:unk08 01 01 06}He didn´t offer his name.
He was rather rude.

4506: {:unk13 8B 00 45 00}{:unk06 02}{:unk08 03 01 05}Rude?
Then it WAS Riku!

4507: {:unk13 01 01 DC 00}{:unk08 01 01 06}Riku´s in the Organization?

4508: {:unk13 DC 00 FA 00}{:unk08 01 00 01}Gawrsh...
---
4509: {:unk13 2C 01 50 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}But why would he come here?

4510: {:unk13 54 01 50 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}I´ll check outside.

to see you. What did he say?

4522: That is all you request?
---
4523: Yes.
---
4524: Dragons have crossed our land
and left a great web of paths.
---
4525: These dragons wield much power, and they are
the source of many gifts to both man and nature.
---
4526: But it would seem someone of evil
intent disturbed one of our dragons,{:delay 18 01}{:clear }and transformed it into what
you call a Heartless.

4527: and transformed it into what
you call a Heartless.
---
4528: It is my belief that this young man
came to warn me of that danger.{:delay 0E 01}{:clear }Then, I could alert and prepare my troops.
---
4529: Then, I could alert and prepare my troops.
---
4530: Did you?
---
4531: I was about to, but he told
me the situation had changed.
---
4532: He said three "wise guys" had arrived,
and they would take care of things.
---
4533: and they would take care of things.
---
4534: That´s gotta be Riku!
---
4535: But what´s he doin´ hangin´
out with Organization {XIII}?

4536: No idea. But at least I
finally know he´s okay.
---
4537: That´s good enough.

4538: Yeah, that´s good!

4539: Now then, Fa Mulan.
Do you have a request?

4540: I´d like Shang...I-I mean... well...
The Captain...
---
4541: Yes, yes, my dear. What is it?
---
4542: Could the Captain have
a vacation, please?

4545: And yet, Mulan...

have survived an avalanche like that.{:clear }We have to find Shan-Yu quickly.
He´s probably headed for the palace.
---
16949: Shan-Yu is supposed to be a
master swordsman, but so are you, Sora.{:clear }If you can parry his attack, I´m sure
you´ll have a chance to strike back.
---
16950: Several companies have already been
attacked by Shan-Yu. We´re out of time.

17092: Hmm? Oh, uh, heh heh, you know, {:delay AA 00}{:clear } {:delay 58 00}{:clear }I didn´t want to bog you down with all the guardianese.
See, there´s a lot to it... {:delay B1 00}{:clear }Did I mention it´s just for us guardians?
---
17096: The door is locked.
---
17436: The path to the summit is a dangerous
one. Many boulders block the way.{:clear }You´ll have to figure out a way to
move those boulders so you can pass.
---
17437: A smart soldier is prepared
for anything.{:clear }Don´t forget to take enough
items with you.
---
17438: You´ll have to take the mountain trail
to the summit.{:clear }Go well armed.
There are lots of enemies.

17699: Mulan joined the army on her
own free will, in place of her father.{:clear }Even so, I´d hate to think what would
happen if her secret got out.
---
17700: Just when I was about to destroy those
creepy things, they got scared and took flight!{:clear }This is a strange company.
---
17701: I'm Chien-Po. That short one there's
Yao, and the skinny guy's Ling.{:clear }Say, what were those things earlier?
Is that what we're up against?
---
17702: There´s a path leading to the palace from
the checkpoint, but it´s closed now.{:clear }Maybe after we finish a few
missions, though, they´ll let us through.
---
17703: Hey, how´ve you been? Say, when are
you going to grow as strong as we are?
---
17704: I´d much rather be training for
an eating contest.
---
17705: Mulan´s been really busy
of late.{:clear }What can you expect, though?
She´s the hero of our nation.
---
17706: Sometimes a single soldier can
change the tide of battle.{:clear }That soldier is Mulan, of course
with the help of you, as well.
---
17707: You can see a burned-down village
from this thicket. Shan-Yu did that.{:clear }His army will stop at nothing
to invade our country.
---
18745: Defeat the Heartless boss!
Use the whirlwind to your advantage!

21515: {:delayandfade 07 B4} 
Although Ping's enlistment was initially
denied, she completes the tasks given to
her, and quickly grows stronger.
 
Everything seems to be on track, when
Mushu speaks up. It seems he's spotted
the infamous Shan-Yu, leader of the Hun
Army.

21516: {:delayandfade 07 B4} 
Sora and his friends head inside the cave
to find the notorious warrior. Defeating
Shan-Yu will surely impress the captain!
 
However, Shan-Yu is nowhere to be seen.
The whole thing was a trap laid out for
Ping and Sora.

Sora and his friends defeat the terror
unleashed by Xigbar, all the while protecting
the Emperor and Captain Shang.
 
The two claim they've come across a young
man in black. Could they be talking about

tremble.
